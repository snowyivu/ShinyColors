うれしいな！","Ehehe! I'm so happy spending the day-off with you, Mano!"
3001002020020,真乃,うん、私もめぐるちゃんが誘ってくれて、うれしいっ,"Yes, I'm also glad that you invited me, Meguru."
3001002020030,めぐる,"さーって、真乃
どこへ行こうかー？","Alright, Mano.
Where should we go?"
3001002020040,真乃,"めぐるちゃんは
どこか見たいお店とかある？","Meguru,
is there like a shop that you want to see?"
3001002020050,めぐる,そうだな～、雑貨屋さんとか見たいかな,"Well, I guess I want to see something like a variety store."
3001002020060,真乃,"雑貨屋さんなら、この先にかわいいお店があるよ
格好いいのがよかったら、あのお店とか……","There's a cute shop just ahead if you want to go to a variety store.
As for a cool one, maybe that shop..."
3001002020070,めぐる,へぇっ、詳しいんだね！,"Heh, you sure know a lot!"
3001002020080,真乃,うん、この辺はよく来るから,"Well, I do come here a lot."
3001002020090,めぐる,"真乃って公園が好きってイメージだったけど
こういうところも来るんだ？",You have this image of preferring parks but you come to these kinds of places too.
3001002020100,真乃,お散歩が好きだから、あちこち見て回るの,I like talking walks so I look around many different places.
3001002020110,真乃,外にいるといろんな風景が見れて、とっても楽しいんだ,"There are a lot of sighs to be seen outside, so it's really enjoyable."
3001002020120,真乃,"例えばこんなふうにゆっくり周りを見渡すとね
……ほわっ","For example, being able to take the time to look around like what we're doing right now. Oh."
3001002020130,真乃,あの鳥さんがこんな都心に……,To see that bird in the middle of the city...
3001002020140,めぐる,"真乃？
まって、どこ行くの？","Mano?
Hold on, where are you going?"
3001002020150,めぐる,"前を見て歩かないと危ないよ
どうしたの、真乃？","It's dangerous to not look ahead while walking.
What's gotten into you, Mano?"
3001002020160,真乃,"ほわっ、ごめん
あそこの電柱に珍しい鳥さんがいたから、つい……","Oh, sorry about that. There's a rare bird over there at that telephone pole that I couldn't help myself."
3001002020170,めぐる,"あ、本当だ、鳥がいるね
この辺では珍しい鳥なの？","Oh, you're right, there is one.
Is it a rare bird around this area?"
3001002020180,真乃,うん、いつもはね、山のほうに棲んでるんだよっ,"Yes. You see, they usually live in the mountains."
3001002020190,めぐる,"へえ～！
……よかったね、珍しい子が見れて！","Heh!
Isn't that nice finding one here!"
3001002020200,真乃,"うんっ
あの羽のモフモフ、かわいいなぁ……","Yes.
Those fluffy wings are so cute."
3001002020210,めぐる,うんうん、モッフモフだよね,"Yes, so fluffy."
3001002020220,真乃,"……ふふ、そうだよね
モフモフやわらかそうだなぁ……ほわぁ～","Fufu, right.
It looks so fluffily soft. Ah."
3001002020230,めぐる,……かっわいい～！,That's so cute!
3001002020240,真乃,"ほわっ！？　ど、どうしたの、めぐるちゃんっ？
急に抱き付いて？","Ah? W-What's the matter, Meguru?
You suddenly embraced me."
3001002020250,めぐる,ほわほわしてて、ほんっとーにかわいいんだから！,So very soft and absolutely adorable!
3001002020260,真乃,"えっ……あ、あれ？
鳥さんのこと……だよね？","Eh? H-Huh?
You're talking about the bird, aren't you?"
3001002020270,めぐる,"鳥もだけど鳥もだけど！
もうっ、かわいいなあっ！","Yes, a bird, a bird!
But, oh so cute!"
3001002020280,真乃,"ううっ、そんなに強くしたら……
く、くるしいよぉ～",Uuh... If you embraced me so hard... I-I'll feel embarrassed.
3001002020290,めぐる,"真乃がかわいいから、仕方ないの！
もうちょ～っと我慢してね！","You're just so cute so there's not helping it!
Just bear with it me for a little longer!"
3001002020300,真乃,"ほわっ
かわいいって、私のことなの～？","Oh...
By cute, you're talking about me?"
3001002020310,めぐる,気が付くのが遅いよ～！,Aren't you a little to late to realize that!

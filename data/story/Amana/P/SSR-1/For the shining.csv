2014004030010,甘奈,ふたりでおでかけ……だよね,"The two of us will be going out, right?"
2014004030020,甘奈,いつもより入念に……,"So, I have to be more careful than before."
2014004030030,甘奈,うん、オッケーかな☆,"Yeah, I think I'm all set."
2014004030040,甘奈,"あ！　プロデューサーさん！
もしかして、待たせちゃった？","Ah! Producer-san!
Did I make you wait?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"おはよう、甘奈
大丈夫、まだ10分前だしな","Morning, Amana.
It's alright, we're still 10 minutes early."
2014004030050,甘奈,"えへ、そう言ってもらえると助かるかも
今日は付き合ってくれてありがと！","Ehe, thanks.
I'm really glad that you'll be accompanying me today!"
2014004030060,甘奈,"お仕事の服だから
プロデューサーさんの意見も聞きたくて","Since this dress will be used for work, I wanted to
hear what you think of it."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"気にしなくて良いぞ
イメージとの兼ね合いもあるからな","Don't think much of it.
After all, there's a fine balance in regards to your
image."
2014004030070,甘奈,うん！　今日は色々とアドバイス欲しいな,Yeah! I want your advice on a lot of things today.
2014004030080,甘奈,"でも、ふたりっきりでお出かけだなんて
まわりから見たらデートに見えちゃったりして☆","Still, with the just the two of us, people might see us
on a date. ☆"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,こら、からかうんじゃない,"Come on now, don't tease me like that."
2014004030090,甘奈,"えへっ、ごめんね☆
じゃあ行こっか、プロデューサーさんっ","Ehe, sorry.
Well, let's go, Producer-san."
2014004030100,甘奈,"このミニ、生地はスエードなんだ？　フレアがかわいー
甘奈、こーいうの好きかも","This mini-skirt is made from suede. And its flare
is cute. I think I kinda like this."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,テレビ映えもしそうだし、衣装との相性も良さそうだ,"It seems that that's going to look good when shown
on TV so it could also work as a show outfit."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,他のはどうだ？,How about the other ones?
2014004030110,甘奈,"あっちのデニム地のも良さそうかな？
それか向こうの花柄ワンピに白カーデを合わせて……","Doesn't that denim over there looks good too?
If that floral dress was to be paired up with a
white cardigan..."
2014004030120,甘奈,うーん……悩むなぁ,Hmm... I can't decide...
2014004030130,甘奈,"プロデューサーさん、ちょっと試着してみるから
実際に見て、意見もらっても良いかな？","Producer, I'll try wearing them so,
would it be alright if you give me your opinion
after seeing it?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,ああ、わかった,"Yeah, sure."
2014004030140,甘奈,えへへ、ありがとっ☆,"Ehehe, thanks."
2014004030150,甘奈,"どーにかふたつのコーデまで絞れたけど……
どっちも良いな～","I managed to narrow it down to just two but...
Both of them are nice."
2014004030160,甘奈,"ピンクメインの甘々コーデかデニムを入れたのか
プロデューサーさん、どっちが良いと思う？","Producer, which do you think is better?
A sweet get-up with a focus on pink or the one
with denim?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"そうだな……俺が選ぶならデニムの方かな
テレビに映った時の印象が強くなる","Let's see... I think I'll go for the denim.
It makes for a better impression when shown in TV."
2014004030170,甘奈,"なるほど……うんっ！　そうだね！
プロデューサーさんの言った方にする！","I see. Okay! You're right!
So, I'll go with what you said!"
2014004030180,甘奈,"……ごめんね、プロデューサーさん
めっちゃ時間かけちゃった","I'm really sorry for taking so much
of your time, Producer-san."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"気にすることないぞ
甘奈が納得できるものを買えて良かったじゃないか","Don't worry about it. Besides, isn't it good that you
were able to buy something that you really like?"
2014004030190,甘奈,"プロデューサーさんのおかげで良い服が買えたよ
ホントにありがと！","I was able to buy some really nice clothes because
of you. I can't thank you enough!"
2014004030200,甘奈,えへへ、この服でお仕事するの楽しみだな☆,"Ehehe, I can't wait to go on a job wearing this! ☆"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,ああ、甘奈によく似合ってたからな,Yeah. It does look really great on you.
2014004030210,甘奈,"似合ってた……
う、うん。ありがと……","Look really great on me...
Y-Yeah. Thanks..."
2014004030220,甘奈,……今日のおでかけ楽しかった,...I really had fun today.
2014004030230,甘奈,……また、一緒に行けたら良いな,...It'd be nice if we were to do it again.

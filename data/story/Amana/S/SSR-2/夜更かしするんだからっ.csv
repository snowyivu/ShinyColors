ここからでも、川の音が聞こえるよ、すごーい！","...Oh!
Wow, you can still hear the sound of the river
even from here!"
3014006030020,千雪,"ここの露天風呂、
自然をすぐ側で感じられるのが特徴なんだって","They say that the open air bath of this place makes
you feel very close to nature."
3014006030030,千雪,"それに、明るい時間にお風呂から見る景色は
とっても綺麗らしいの","And also, it seems that the view seen when taking
a bath during the day is really wonderful."

じゃあ、明日の朝にまた入ろうよ！","Oh～! How about we take another bath tomorrow
morning?"
3014006030050,甜花,"朝……
起きられる、かな……",Can Tenka... be up early by morning...?
3014006030060,甘奈,"大丈夫だよ～
甘奈がちゃんと起こしてあげる！","Don't worry about it～
I'll be sure to wake you up!"
3014006030070,千雪,"ふふ、温泉でゆっくりしてからぐっすり眠れば、
気持ちよく起きられると思うわ","Fufu, seeing that we took our time at the hot spring
earlier, I think that we'd be able to sleep well and
wake up feeling better."

でも──","Right! Ah!
But──"
3014006030090,甘奈,温泉に入っても今日は終わらないよ……！,"Just because we're done with the bath, it
doesn't mean that the day's over...!"
3014006030100,甜花,え……どういうこと……？,Eh... What do you mean...?
3014006030110,甘奈,えへ！　それは後でのお楽しみ！,"Ehe, just look forward to it later!"

3014006030130,甘奈,もうお布団敷いてくれてるんだ～,The futons are all laid out now.
3014006030140,甜花,"わあ……ふかふか……
……おやすみなさい……",Aah... so fluffy... good night...
3014006030150,甘奈,"甜花ちゃん、お布団気持ちいいのはわかるけど
寝るのはちょっと早いよ～！","Tenka, I know how the futon feels so nice, 
but it's a little bit too early to sleep!"
3014006030160,甘奈,まだまだ夜は終わらないんだから☆,The night has just begun☆
3014006030170,甘奈,甘奈ね、いっぱい遊ぶもの持ってきたんだ～,"You see, I brought a lot of things that we can
play with～"
3014006030180,甜花,それって、お風呂に入る前に言ってた、お楽しみ……？,"Is that what you meant earlier before we took
a bath...?"
3014006030190,甘奈,"えへへ、正解☆
千雪さんが戻ってきたら遊ぼ～","Ehehe, correct☆
Let's play once Chiyuki-san comes back."
3014006030200,甜花,なーちゃん、何持ってきたの……？,"Naa-chan, what did you bring...?"
3014006030210,甘奈,"えっとね～、トランプでしょ、ボードゲームでしょ～
他にも、まだまだあるよっ","Well～ I have some playing cards and some board 
games～ There's also many others."
3014006030220,甜花,"そんなにいっぱい……
すごい……",You brought that much...? Wow....
3014006030230,甘奈,"えへへ☆
３人でこうやってお泊りなんて、あんまりできないし","Ehehe, the three of us don't really get many chances 
of staying together like this."
3014006030240,甘奈,"色んなことして遊びたいなって思ったら
いっぱいになっちゃった","When I started to think of the things I want to play
with you two, it just turned out to be so many."
3014006030250,甜花,なーちゃん……,Naa-chan...
3014006030260,甘奈,"ねえねえ、千雪さんが戻ってくる前に
準備しとこうよ","Say, let's get things ready before Chiyuki-san
gets here."
3014006030270,甜花,"うん……
最初は、何にしよう……？","Okay...
What should we play first?"
3014006030280,甘奈,"どうしよ？
甜花ちゃんは何したい？","What should we do?
Tenka-chan, what do you want to play?"
3014006030290,甜花,"えっと、えっと……

M-Maybe... playing cards...?"
3014006030300,甘奈,"定番だもんね☆
じゃあ、なんの遊びがいいかな～","Well, playing cards is a must☆
Okay, I wonder what should we play with this～"
3014006030310,甜花,"３人で……
えっと、神経衰弱とか、かな……？","Since there's three of us...
Umm, maybe ""Pairs"" or something?"
3014006030320,甘奈,いいね～☆,That's a good idea～☆
3014006030330,甘奈,"それじゃ、すぐできるように
先にトランプ並べておこっか","Alright, let's lay out the cards so that we can
play right away."
3014006030340,甘奈,──よし、準備完了☆,"There, all done."
3014006030350,甜花,千雪さん……なかなか戻ってこないね……,"Chiyuki-san... sure is taking a long time to come
back..."
3014006030360,甘奈,"ね～、それじゃあ……
千雪さんが戻るまでちょっとだけ──","I know, right...
In that case, while Chiyuki-san isn't around──"
3014006030370,甘奈,"ふかふかのお布団にー……
ドーン！","I'll jump in to the fluffy futon──......

3014006020310,千雪,"ううん、大げさだってかまわないの

3014006020400,甜花,……あむ……あむ……んっ,Om... nom... mmm.
3014006020410,甜花,"ほくほくして……甘い……

もう１個……","Oh, it's all gone... One more..."
3014006020430,千雪,ふふっ……,Fufu.

3014006020450,甜花,お腹、いっぱい……,Tenka's full now...
3014006020460,千雪,"うん……！
ちょっと食べ過ぎちゃったかも……？","Yes. Perhaps, we ate a little too much?"
3014006020470,甘奈,"お腹もいっぱいになったし、
ちょっとお散歩しない？","Since we're all full, how about we take a quick stroll?"
3014006020480,甜花,"あ、それなら……！
千雪さん……","Ah, in that case... Chiyuki..."
3014006020490,千雪,"……！　そうね……
甘奈ちゃん、ちょっとついてきてくれる？","Oh, right. Amana, would you follow me, please?"
3014006020500,甘奈,"なになに？
楽しそうな顔して、なにがあるのっ？","What is it? You two look like very happy, did you get your hands on something?"
3014006020510,千雪,それは……着いてからのお楽しみ♪,"Well, just look forward to it when we get there."
3014006020520,甘奈,わぁあっ……,Aah.
3014006020530,甘奈,"すごい……
めっちゃ……綺麗","Wow, it's so beautiful."
3014006020540,甘奈,"旅館のお部屋で見えたのもすごかったけど……
ここの……なんていうんだろ",It was beautiful when I saw it by the inn's window but... This... What is it called again?
3014006020550,甘奈,"緑がずっと続いてて……
吸い込まれちゃいそう……",The lush greens just keep on going... It feels like it's going I'm being sucked in...
3014006020560,甜花,にへへ……良かった……,Nihehe... Glad you liked it...
3014006020570,甘奈,"…………景色だけじゃなくて
風で葉っぱが揺れる音も、気持ちいい……",It's not just the view but the sound being made when the wind passes by the leaves feels so good.
3014006020580,甘奈,"……甜花ちゃん、千雪さん、よくここ知ってたね
ガイドブックに、載ってたの？","Tenka, Chiyuki, you seem to know about this place. Was this in the guidebook?"
3014006020590,千雪,"ううん。実は、旅館の人に聞いたの
地元の人もあまり知らない、とっておきスポットなんだって","No. Actually, we heard it from someone at the inn. Not even the locals know about this, so this is really a special spot."
3014006020600,甘奈,"そっかぁ……
だから他に、誰もいないんだね……","I see. So, that's why there's no other people around."
3014006020610,甜花,"うん……
なーちゃんと、甜花と、千雪さん……だけ、だよ","Yes... This place is just for... Naa-chan, Tenka and Chiyuki..."
3014006020620,甘奈,"この景色……
３人で独占しちゃうなんて——",To think that we would have this view to just ourselves...
3014006020630,甘奈,——こんな贅沢、初めてかも,I guess this is the first time I got something so grand.

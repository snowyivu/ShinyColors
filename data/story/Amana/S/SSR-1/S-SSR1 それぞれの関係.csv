また一緒に来られてめっちゃ楽しかった！","Thank you for today, Chiyuki.
It was fun coming again here!"

私もとっても楽しかったわ","Thank you, too. I also enjoyed myself."
3014004030040,千雪,それにしても、結構長居しちゃってたのね……！,"Still, we spent quite a long time there."
3014004030050,甘奈,"つい長いことまったりしちゃうんだよねー！
いつの間にこんな時間！？　みたいな","We sure took our sweet time there!
Like to the point of ""Wait, it's already this late!?"""
3014004030060,甘奈,"お店の雰囲気もいいし、
面白そうな本がたくさんあるからかなぁ……？",Maybe it's because the store has a nice ambiance and have lots of interesting books?
3014004030070,千雪,"そういえば甘奈ちゃん、何か買ってたけど……
どんな本を買ったの？","Speaking of which, Amana, you seem to have bought something. What kind of book is it?"
3014004030080,甘奈,"うん☆　今日はねー
主人公がめっちゃかわいー女の子の小説と絵本を買ったの！","Oh that. Well, I bought a novel which has a cute girl for its lead and a picture book!"
3014004030090,千雪,"可愛い女の子？
最近、流行ってる小説かしら？",A cute girl? Is that the one that's quite popular right now?
3014004030100,甘奈,ううん、教科書に載ってた小説なんだ,"No, it's a novel mentioned in our textbooks."
3014004030110,甘奈,先生が全部読んだら面白いって、授業中に言ってたの,Our teacher said that we'll find it interesting once we read about it.
3014004030120,千雪,"そっかぁ
教科書のお話って、ちゃんと読んでみると……","I see. So, you decided to read the references mentioned in your textbook."
3014004030130,千雪,"実は結構面白かったり
良い話だったりするもんね","There are really interesting and good stories, aren't there?"
3014004030140,甘奈,"うんっ
だから、読むの楽しみにしてるんだ☆",Yeah. That's why I can't wait to read them.
3014004030150,甘奈,それと、絵本はこれ！,"As for the other one, it's this picture book!"
3014004030160,甘奈,小さな頃に読んでもらってて、好きなお話だったの,This one has been read to me when I was a kid and I liked its story.
3014004030170,甘奈,"それで
甜花ちゃんと一緒に読んだら楽しいかな～って思ったんだ☆","So, I thought this could be a fun read with Tenka."
3014004030180,千雪,この絵本……私も読んだことがあるわ,I've also read that picture book before.
3014004030190,甘奈,"えっ、千雪さんもなんだ！
ついつい惹き込まれちゃうよねー","Oh, you read it too! It sure makes you engrossed to it!"
3014004030200,千雪,"うん
私の弟がね、このお話が大好きで……",Yes. And my little brother loves this story.
3014004030210,千雪,小さい頃はよく読み聞かせしてあげてたの,I read it to him a lot when we were young.
3014004030220,甘奈,"千雪さんの弟かぁ、この前写真見せてくれたよね
めっちゃかわいかった～",Your little brother. You showed a picture of him before. He was so cute.
3014004030230,千雪,ふふ、あれは小学生の頃の写真だけどね,"Fufu, although, that picture was when he was back in elementary."
3014004030240,千雪,"昔は、カメラを向けたらすぐに
ポーズを取ってくれたんだけど……","Before, when I point the camera at him, he immediately strikes into a pose."
3014004030250,甘奈,今は撮らせてくれないんだ？,"But, he doesn't let you take his picture anymore?"
3014004030260,千雪,"そうなの
『やだよ』って顔を隠されちゃって",Yes. He turns me down and hides his face away.
3014004030270,甘奈,"へー、そういう反応されるんだね
お姉ちゃんと弟だとそうなっちゃうのかな？","Oh, he reacts like that. Does the relationship between big sister and her little brother always turn out like that?"
3014004030280,甘奈,"甘奈と甜花ちゃんは
今でも手を繋いだりするから","I mean, Tenka and I still do things like holding hands."
3014004030290,千雪,"ふふっ
ふたりはいつまでも仲良しね","Fufu, the two of us are always getting along."
3014004030300,甘奈,"えへへ、あ、でも、昔と反応が変わっちゃったりすると……
ちょっと寂しかったり？","Ehehe, oh, but, if one person's reaction changes from what he usually does in the past... Isn't that a little sad?"
3014004030310,千雪,うーん……そんなことないかな,Hmm... I don't think so.
3014004030320,千雪,"今は今で
実家に戻った時はゆっくり話したりできるから……","Whenever I go back home, we could still talk about things."
3014004030330,甘奈,"そうなんだ
仲が悪くなっちゃったわけじゃないんだね","I see. So, you two didn't stop getting along with each other."
3014004030340,千雪,"そうね
もう子供の頃の関係とは違うけれど",Yes. Although it's now different than when we were kids.
3014004030350,甘奈,違う関係、か……,Different...
3014004030360,千雪,……甘奈ちゃん？,...Amana?
3014004030370,甘奈,"甘奈と甜花ちゃんの場合はどうだろ……
これからふたりの関係は変わっちゃったりするのかな……",I wonder about me and Tenka... I wonder if our relationship would change in the future...
3014004030380,千雪,……変わるのは怖い？,...Are you afraid of change?
3014004030390,甘奈,"怖いっていうよりもね……
あんまりそういうこと、思ったことがなくて……",Not that I'm afraid but... It's just that I haven't thought about it much...
3014004030400,甘奈,"今までも……そして今もずっと一緒だから……
考えられないっていうか……","Up until now... And even right now, the two of us are always together... So, it's like I can't think of it happening..."
3014004030410,千雪,甘奈ちゃん……,Amana...
3014004030420,千雪,……きっと、大丈夫！,I'm sure that it will be alright!
3014004030430,甘奈,！　千雪さん……,Chiyuki...
3014004030440,千雪,"私もね……
変わっていくことは、少し寂しかったけれど",It's the same with me. I'm also afraid of things changing but...
3014004030450,千雪,"それは『関係が成長した』
ってことなんじゃないかなって思うの",I think that that's a sign that our relationship has grown.
3014004030460,千雪,"私たち自身が大人になったり、
変わっていくように……ね？",Like us oursleves will change into grown-ups. Don't you agree?
3014004030470,甘奈,……そっかぁ,...I see.
3014004030480,甘奈,"『関係が成長』……
そんなふうにも考えられるんだ……",Our relationship has grown... you could think of it like that...
3014004030490,甘奈,"それってなんだか……
すごく素敵な感じがするね……！",And... that seems like a wonderful thing!
3014004030500,甘奈,"甘奈たちのこれからが、もっと楽しくなりそうな気がするよ
ありがと！　千雪さんっ","I feel like the relationship between me and Tenka will become even more fun. Thank you, Chiyuki!"

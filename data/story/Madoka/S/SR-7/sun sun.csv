3021017020010,円香,小糸、撮影まだかかるって,Koito said that the shoot might take a while longer.
3021017020020,雛菜,"へ～～～
肉フェスもう始まってるのに～","Huh～～～
But the Meat Festival's about to start～"
3021017020030,透,先行っていいって,That's why shee said we can go first.
3021017020040,雛菜,……どうしようかな～,...What should we do～
3021017020050,雛菜,"早く行かないと
雛菜が食べたいやつ売り切れちゃうかも～","If we don't go soon, the meats that Hinana want to
eat might get sold out～"
3021017020060,円香,"だったら
先行けば？","Then, why don't we go first?"
3021017020070,雛菜,ん～……,Hm～...
3021017020080,透,"じゃあ、待つ？
どっかで","How about, we wait?
Somewhere."
3021017020090,雛菜,"そんなに時間かからないなら
コンビニとか？","If the shoot isn't gonna take too long, maybe we
can chill at a convenience store?"
3021017020100,透,"あー
あったっけ","Ahhー
Is there one around?"
3021017020110,円香,"あるけど
少し歩く",There's one. If you walk a bit.
3021017020120,雛菜,でも外暑いよ～,But it's so hot outside～
3021017020130,円香,とりあえずビルの中に戻る？,How about we return into the building for now?
3021017020140,透,オッケー,Okeyy.
3021017020150,雛菜,"小糸ちゃん
今からインタビューも録るんだって～","Koito-chan said that they're going to record the
interview from now, too～"
3021017020160,雛菜,"それならスタジオの中で待ってたほうが
涼しかったのに～","If that's how it went we should have stayed and
waited in the studio where it's cool."
3021017020170,円香,"さすがに現場まで戻るのは迷惑だから
ここで待つしかない","We'll be causing the staff trouble if we go back to
the job location. We can only wait here."
3021017020180,雛菜,透先輩、どこ行くの～？,"Toru-senpai, where are you going～?"
3021017020190,円香,……,...
3021017020200,透,"ありゃ
立入禁止","Yikes.
No trespassing, it says."
3021017020210,雛菜,屋上入れないね～,"We can't get onto the roof, right～?"
3021017020220,円香,そりゃそうでしょ,Obviously not.
3021017020230,円香,"冒険はおしまい
戻ろ",Adventure's over. Let's head back.
3021017020240,透,まだ,Just a sec.
3021017020250,透,"光ってる
めっちゃ","It's shining.
A lot."
3021017020260,円香,……,...
3021017020270,透,"……あ
ダメなんだっけ","...Ah.
It's not good, you said."
3021017020280,透,見過ぎたら,If I stared at it.
3021017020290,円香,"……直視したらね
そのくらいは別に","...Only if you're look directly into it.
It's not so bad if it's just this."
3021017020300,円香,何か見えた？,Did you see anything?
3021017020310,透,んー,Hmー
3021017020320,雛菜,雛菜よくわかんない～,Hinana can't really make it out.
3021017020330,透,"あ
見えたかも","Ah.
I think I did."
3021017020340,透,空,The sky.
3021017020350,円香,……,...
3021017020360,円香,このビル、高層ビルに囲まれてたけど,But this building is surrounded by high-rise buildings.
3021017020370,円香,"見えたとしても
コンクリートの壁とかじゃない？","Even if you can see, wouldn't it just be concrete
walls?"
3021017020380,透,"え、でも
光ってるから","Huh, but it's shining."
3021017020390,透,"あるでしょ
空","So it should be there.
The sky."
3021017020400,雛菜,"あは～
雛菜もある気がする～！","Aha～
Hinana thinks it might be there too～!"
3021017020410,円香,そりゃあるだろうけど,"Well, of course there would be one."
3021017020420,円香,"真上に
小さな空くらいは","There'd be a sky right above.
Even if it's just a small one."
3021017020430,円香,"……けどそれって
何もないより、空しいんじゃない？","...But rather than saying that nothing's there,
isn't there emptiness?"
3021017020440,雛菜,そうかな～,"Is it like that, though～"
3021017020450,雛菜,"あったかい光でいっぱいだから
しあわせ～って感じかもしれないよ～？","Since

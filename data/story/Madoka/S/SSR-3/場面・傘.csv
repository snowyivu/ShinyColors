3021007030010,雛菜,ね、円香先輩,"Hey, Madoka-senpai."
3021007030020,円香,……何,...What.
3021007030030,雛菜,"傘
雛菜が持つ～？",Why not let Hinana hold the umbrella~?
3021007030040,円香,"いい
雛菜、真ん中で持たないから","It's fine.
Cos Hinana won't share it in between us."
3021007030050,雛菜,へ～？,Hee~?
3021007030060,円香,"雛菜が持ってた時、
肩、っていうか８割濡れた","Whenever Hinana holds it,
my shoulders would get wet 80% of the time."
3021007030070,雛菜,"ん～
そうだった～？","Hm~
Really~?"
3021007030080,円香,そうだった,Really.
3021007030090,雛菜,"……だけど
円香先輩もちゃんと持ててないでしょ～？","...But Madoka-senpai isn't holding it properly
too~?"
3021007030100,円香,なんで,What makes you say that?
3021007030110,雛菜,"傘、
雛菜の頭に当たってるんですけど～","Because the umbrella keeps hitting Hinana's
head~"
3021007030120,円香,頭、下げれば,Lower your head then.
3021007030130,雛菜,へ～……,Hee~...
3021007030140,円香,"……
やっぱり一本じゃ無理","...
I guess an umbrella really isn't enough for the two of
us."
3021007030150,円香,行くよ、もう一軒。コンビニ,Let's go get another. At the convenience store.
3021007030160,雛菜,"ん～
このあたりにコンビニあった～？","Yea~
Was there a convenient stores around here?"
3021007030170,円香,無いの？,Is there one?
3021007030180,雛菜,うん～,Hmm~
3021007030190,雛菜,じゃあ止むまで、雨宿りする～？,Then let's seek shelter until the rain stops~?
3021007030200,円香,どこで,Where?
3021007030210,雛菜,そのへんのビルの下とか～？,"Like, under that building or somewhere～?"
3021007030220,円香,…………,......
3021007030230,円香,"じゃあ、そうすれば
私は傘で帰る",In that case I'm going home with the umbrella.
3021007030240,雛菜,へ～！？,Hee~!?
3021007030250,雛菜,雨宿りするの、円香先輩でしょ～？,"Shouldn't Madoka-senpai be the one that should
be waiting under the shelter~?"
3021007030260,円香,…………,......
3021007030270,雛菜,わ、何～～～！？,"Wah, what~~!?"
3021007030280,円香,主導権どっちにあると思ってんの,Who do you think is taking the lead here.
3021007030290,雛菜,雛菜の傘～！,But it's Hinana's umbrella~!
3021007030300,円香,買ったの私で、しょ……！,"Well the person who bought it was, me...!"
3021007030310,雛菜,"あ～……
びしょびしょ～……","Ah~...
Now I'm all soaked~..."
3021007030320,円香,…………,......
3021007030330,円香,……何,...What.
3021007030340,円香,"言うほど濡れてないじゃん
さっき雛菜が持ってた時の方が全然濡れたんだけど","You're not That wet.
I was soaked way worse when Hinana held it
just now."
3021007030350,雛菜,"あ……
そこ左～","Ah...
Over there to our left~"
3021007030360,円香,コンビニ？,A convenience store?
3021007030370,雛菜,"ううん
ドラッグストアがあった気がする～","Nope.
I think there's a drug store there~"
3021007030380,円香,それ早く言ってよ,You could have said so earlier.
3021007030390,雛菜,今思い出したの～,I just remembered~
3021007030400,雛菜,"……雛菜、
今日お財布持ってないからね～？","...Hinana, forgot her wallet today, you know~?"
3021007030410,円香,"知ってる
さっきもコンビニで聞いた","I know.
You already said that in the convenience store just
now."
3021007030420,円香,……後日、利子つけて請求するから,"...Worry not. I'll send a bill to you on a later date,
with interest."
3021007030430,雛菜,"利子～～～？
円香先輩、悪徳金融～……","Interest~~~?
Madoka-senpai's an evil money lender~......"
3021007030440,円香,雛菜が自分勝手な理由で逃げてもいいようにね,"Though Hinana will just come up with a reason and get
get away with it anyways."
3021007030450,雛菜,何それ～,What's that supposed to mean~
3021007030460,円香,"たとえば交換日記
毎日交換するとは決まってないって止めてた","Remember the diary exchange?
You stopped exchanging cos you said we didn't
have a rule to exchange everyday."
3021007030470,雛菜,"へ～？
そうだっけ～……？","Hee~?
Was that what happened~...?"
3021007030480,雛菜,"ん～、でも
それって","Hm~, but about that,"
3021007030490,雛菜,"最後、ほんとに止めたのは
円香先輩じゃなかった～？","wasn't Madoka-senpai the one that eventually
stopped the whole thing altogether~?"
3021007030500,雛菜,"どうせいつか終わるんだから、
いつ終えたっていいでしょ～って","""We're going to end it someday, so it's fine to
end it anytime"" was what you said~"
3021007030510,円香,……よく覚えてるね,...You sure remember it well.
3021007030520,雛菜,"あは～
まあね～","Aha~
I guess~"
3021007030530,雛菜,"この間も円香先輩が
交換日記って言ってたから──","It's cos the other time time, Madoka-senpai
mentioned about the diary exchange, so──"
3021007030540,雛菜,"あ～～～！
ほら、ドラッグストアあった！","Ah~~~!
See, there really is a drug store here!"
3021007030550,円香,んー,Yea─
3021007030560,雛菜,傘、傘～,"Umbrella, umbrella~"

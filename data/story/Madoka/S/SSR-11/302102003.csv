3021020030210,雛菜,"あは～、そうなんだ～
雛菜もちょっと休めたいかも","Aha～ That's what it does, huh～
Hinana might want some of that relieving."
3021020030220,円香,"そういうのを見越して
うちは控えめにしてたから","My family expected that to happen
so we managed to avoid overindulging ourselves."
3021020030230,円香,それでも飽食状態だったけど,But we still ended up stuffed.

3021020030320,雛菜,"でもそれ何入ってるかわからないんでしょ～
選べないなら雛菜はいいや～","But you don't know what's inside, right?
If I can't what's inside, Hinana's gonna pass～"
3021020030330,円香,欲しいなら買えば？,"Well, if you want it, why not buy it?"
3021020030340,小糸,"う、うん……
でも、他のも見てからにしようかな……","Y-Yeah......
But, I was thinking of getting it after looking at
what else is here."
3021020030350,雛菜,……あ、あれはなんだろ～,"......Ah, hey what do you think that is～"

樋口は？","I don't remember.
What about you, Higuchi?"
3021020030430,円香,……私も,Me neither.
3021020030440,雛菜,じゃあ誰も占えないね～,"Then none of us can have our fortune told, huh～"
3021020030450,円香,"そんな時間ないし
おつかい頼まれてるんだから","We're running an errand
so we don't have time to waste anyway."
3021020030460,透,あー,Ahh.

甘奈ちゃん、可愛い……！","Wow...
You're so cute, Amana-chan...!"
3016010010020,甜花,"うん……なーちゃん、可愛い……
全部、似合うね……","Yeah... Naa-chan's so pretty...
Everything, looks good on her..."
3016010010030,甘奈,"ありがとー！　千雪さん、甜花ちゃん☆
この雑誌の撮影、めっちゃ気合い入れてたんだ～","Thank you! Chiyuki-san, Tenka-chan☆
I put a lot of effort into the photoshoot for this magazine~"
3016010010040,千雪,甘奈ちゃんらしいなぁ,"It's just like you to do that, Amana-chan."
3016010010050,千雪,"『夏らしいファッションで揃えてみました』──
うん、コンセプトもちゃんと伝わる","『A Feature on Summerlike Fashion』ー
The concept for this issue really came through."
3016010010060,甘奈,えへへ、褒められちゃった☆,"Ehehe, I'm being praised☆"
3016010010070,甜花,──『日焼け対策はいつも念入りに』……,──『Always thorough with her sunburn preparations』...
3016010010080,千雪,うん、えらいなぁ……！,"Mhm, that's admirable...!"
3016010010090,甘奈,"日焼け対策のこと
めっちゃ話しちゃった☆","I talked a lot about
how to protect yourself from sunburns☆"
3016010010100,甜花,"うん……なーちゃん……
日焼け止め、色々持ってたり、すごい……","That's right... Naa-chan...
Brings a lot of things, like sunscreens... It's amazing..."
3016010010110,甘奈,紫外線は一年中あるからね！,"Ultraviolet rays are always present, after all!"
3016010010120,甜花,"甜花も……なーちゃんにもらうこと、ある……
サプリみたいな……飲むやつとか……","Naa-chan... gave Tenka stuff for that too...
Things like... supplements to drink and others..."
3016010010130,甘奈,普段からケアするのに便利だもんね～,"It's convenient for personal care routines, after all~"
3016010010140,甘奈,"あ！　そうだ！
千雪さんの対策、聞いてみたい！","Ah! That reminds me!
I want to hear about your own countermeasures, Chiyuki-san!"
3016010010150,千雪,ええっ、私……？,What? Me...?
3016010010160,千雪,"その……私は全然、大したことないの
なんとなく、素材はハーブのものがいいかなってくらい","Uhm... I don't really do anything special.
I just use some herbs that I think are good one way or another."
3016010010170,千雪,"甘奈ちゃんみたいに色々持ってるわけじゃないんだけど、
肌には合ってる気がするから","I don't have a wide selection of things like you do,
but it's because I think what I do is enough for my skin."
3016010010180,甘奈,"ハーブなんだ～！
千雪さんの優しいイメージにピッタリ☆","So it is herbs~!
It does fit your gentle image☆"
3016010010190,甘奈,"でも、ハーブって優しいぶん
季節によってはお肌、守り切れなかったりするかも……","But I think that the gentleness of herbs
might not be enough for your skin, especially across seasons..."
3016010010200,甘奈,甘奈も自然素材のはちょっと詳しくないけど……,Not that Amana's well-informed about natural products though...
3016010010210,千雪,あ、紫外線の量も違うんだもんね,"Ah, it's because the amount of ultraviolet rays changes, right?"
3016010010220,甘奈,"うん、だから
千雪さんも使い分け、してみてもいいのかなぁって","Yup, that's why I think
it would be nice if you would also try out alternatives."
3016010010230,甘奈,"もちろん、今のでも大丈夫かもしれないけど
もっと合うの、あるかもだから","Of course, I think you're okay right now but
I think there's something that would fit you more."
3016010010240,千雪,"うん
甘奈ちゃんにアドバイスしてもらえるの、頼もしい……！","Mhm.
It's reassuring, being given advice from you...!"
3016010010250,甜花,"なーちゃんの日焼け止め……
よく効く……","Naa-chan's recommendations...
Work really well..."
3016010010260,千雪,"そうなの？
それじゃ、使い分けが効いてるのね、きっと","Is that so?
In that case, I'm sure the alternative she'll suggest will work well too."
3016010010270,千雪,私にもおすすめを教えてほしいな……！,I can't wait to hear what you'll be recommending me...!
3016010010280,甘奈,"じゃあ、今度お店行ってみよっか！
実物を見ながら選んだ方が良さそう！","Well then, why don't we try going to a store next time?
It's easier to choose when we can see it!"
3016010010290,千雪,わ、嬉しい……！,"Wow, that makes me happy...!"
3016010010300,千雪,私、つい慣れてるものばっかり使っちゃうから──,"You see, I've only really been using stuff that I'm used to."
3016010010310,甘奈,新しいものってたまに失敗しちゃうもんね～,"It's because trying out new things doesn't always work out, right~?"
3016010010320,甘奈,"買った後で、なんか違う～って
思っちゃったり","Like after buying it, you suddenly think that
it feels a bit different from before."
3016010010330,千雪,"ふふっ
私も使わないのに買っちゃったりするかも","Fufu.
Sometimes I also end up buying stuff I never use."
3016010010340,甘奈,"なんでこれ買ったの？
ってその時の自分に聞きたくなるよね～","Those moments where you end up asking yourself,
""Why did I even buy this?"", right~?"
3016010010350,甘奈,"でも、新しいの買うたびに、
すっごく楽しくなっちゃう！","But to be honest, it's really fun
whenever you get to buy new things!"
3016010010360,甘奈,確かに失敗しちゃうこともあるけど……,"I'm sure it won't always work out, but..."
3016010010370,甘奈,"パッケージかわいーとか、お肌に合うといいな～とか
考えながらお買い物してるとワクワクしちゃって──！","Shopping is always so exciting whenever I think about how cute 
the package is, or how nice it would be if it worked well on my skin!"
3016010010380,甘奈,だから、千雪さんもどうかなぁって……！,That's why I'm curious about how it would be for you...!
3016010010390,千雪,…………！,...!
3016010010400,甘奈,どうしたの？,What's wrong?
3016010010410,千雪,"……うん、すっごく素敵
新しい挑戦って、ワクワクすることだよね……！","...Yeah, it sounds wonderful.
Challenging yourself with something new is pretty exciting, huh...!"
3016010010420,甘奈,千雪さん……？,Chiyuki-san...?
3016010010430,千雪,"ふふっ、いいかも
私も新しい日焼け止めに挑戦します……！","Fufu, I think it sounds great.
I want to challenge myself with a new sunscreen too...!"
3016010010440,甘奈,えへへ、ぴったりのやつ、見つけようね☆,"Ehehe, let's find you one that fits you perfectly, okay☆"
3016010010450,甜花,…………,...
3016010010460,甜花,"それなら、甜花も……
日焼け止め……ほしい、かも……！","In that case, Tenka...
wants to try... a new sunscreen too...!"
3016010010470,甘奈,ホント！？,Really!?
3016010010480,甜花,う、うん……！,Y-Yeah...!
3016010010490,甜花,"夏だから……
甜花も、自分の欲しいなって……挑戦……！","It's summer...
That's why Tenka... wants to challenge herself too...!"
3016010010500,千雪,わ、じゃあ３人で買いに行こっか……？,"Wow, then should all three of us go shopping together...?"
3016010010510,甜花,"うん……！
みんなで……お買い物……！","Yeah...!
Let's go shopping... together...!"
3016010010520,甘奈,オフが待ち遠しいな～,I can't wait for our day off~

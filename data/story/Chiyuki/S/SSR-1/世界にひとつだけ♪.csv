3016004030010,千雪,"じゃあまずは、
買った生地を、型紙にそって切っていきましょう","First of all, let's cut up the fabric you bought using 
the pattern paper."
3016004030020,甘奈,"はーい
千雪先生、よろしくお願いしまーす☆","Okaaaay.
Chiyuki-sensei, we're in your hands☆"
3016004030030,甜花,千雪先生……お願いします……！,Chiyuki-sensei... Please take care of us...!
3016004030040,千雪,"先生……
改めてそう呼ばれると、なんだか緊張しちゃう","Sensei (Teacher)...
It kinda makes me nervous, being called that."
3016004030050,千雪,"甘奈ちゃんは２匹めのクマさんだから、
甜花ちゃんのフォローもお願いね","This is Amana-chan's second bear,
so I'll be relying on you to support Tenka-chan, okay?"
3016004030060,甜花,なーちゃんも……先生……,Naa-chan's also... my teacher...
3016004030070,甘奈,"えー！
先生とか呼ばれると緊張しちゃうよー！","Eh!?
I'll get nervous if you call me something like that!"
3016004030080,千雪,"ふふ
では、なーちゃん先生もハサミを持ってくださーい","Fufu.
Well then, Naa-chan-sensei, please hold the scissors!"
3016004030090,甘奈,"は、はーい……！
……これに合わせて切ればいいの？","O-Okay...!
...Should I cut it along the pattern paper?"
3016004030100,千雪,"うん、そうね
周りを少しだけ残して切ってね","Yup, that's good.
Cut it so that only a bit is left around its circumference."
3016004030110,甜花,"生地、きれい……
ちょっと……もったいない……","The fabric, so pretty...
It's kind of... a waste..."
3016004030120,千雪,"そうよね……でも、想像してみて？
この生地が、世界でひとつだけのぬいぐるみになるの","It does seem like it but... why don't we try imagining 
this? That fabric, it'll be made into a one-of-a-kind 
stuffed animal."
3016004030130,甜花,"最高の……クマになる……？
甜花、できるかな……","It'll turn... into a wonderful stuffed bear...?
I wonder, can Tenka do it..."
3016004030140,千雪,そう。だから自信を持って！,"Yes, you can. That's why you should be confident!"
3016004030150,甜花,う、うん……！,O-Okay...!
3016004030160,甘奈,"なんか、教えてもらうと全然ちがーう
ガンガン切っていけるなー","It feels kinda different when it's being taught to you.
It's super easy cutting the fabric up～"
3016004030170,千雪,"わ、甘奈ちゃん早い
じゃあ、ちょっとアクセサリーも作ってみましょうか","Wah, you finished so fast, Amana-chan.
Now then, why don't we try making a few accessories 
too?"
3016004030180,甘奈,"え、本当ー？
作る作る！","Oh! Really?
I want to try making some!"
3016004030190,甜花,う……うぅ……,U-Uuu...
3016004030200,千雪,甜花ちゃん、難しい……？,"Tenka-chan, are you having a hard time?"
3016004030210,甜花,"うん……
甜花、なーちゃんみたいに、できない……","Mhm...
Tenka, can't do it like Naa-chan..."
3016004030220,千雪,"あら、甜花ちゃんも甘奈ちゃんと同じ布なのね
……すごい、切り方もそっくり……！","Oh, the cloth you're using is the same as 
Amana-chan's, right?
... Wow, even the way you cut it is the same...!"
3016004030230,甜花,"うん……
なーちゃんの……お手本……","Yup...
I just copied... Naa-chan..."
3016004030240,甜花,"でも……
すごく……む、難しい……","But even then...
It's really... difficult..."
3016004030250,甘奈,甜花ちゃん、甘奈も手伝う！,"Tenka-chan, Amana will also give you a hand!"
3016004030260,千雪,ううん、甘奈ちゃん、大丈夫よ,"No, it's okay, Amana-chan."
3016004030270,甘奈,え……？,Huh...?
3016004030280,千雪,"ふふ、うん……
きっと、お手伝いがなくても、大丈夫じゃないかな","Fufu, well...
Even without help, she'll probably do fine."
3016004030290,千雪,"甜花ちゃん……
昨日甜花ちゃんが買ってた布はどうしたの？","Tenka-chan...
What happened to the cloth that you bought 
yesterday?"
3016004030300,甜花,"え、えと……
あれは……つ、使わないから……","U-Uhm...
That's... I won't be using it so..."
3016004030310,千雪,"そうなの？
どうして使わないか、よかったら教えて？","Is that so?
Would it be alright for you to tell me why you won't 
be using it?"
3016004030320,甜花,"うぅ……
あれ……クマっぽく……ないから……","Uu...
It's... not really bear-like... so..."
3016004030330,千雪,"ああ……やっぱりそうだったのね
お星さまの柄のクマさんは、ダメ……？","Aah... So it really is like I thought it was.
Do you think that a bear patterned with stars is no 
good?"
3016004030340,甜花,"う……み、みんなと、違う……
なーちゃんとも……","Uu... I-It's different from everyone's...
Even from Naa-chan's..."
3016004030350,千雪,"そっかぁ……
甘奈ちゃん、課題に材料の指定はないのよね？","I see...
Amana-chan, the assignment didn't tell you to use 
specific materials, right?"
3016004030360,甘奈,"うん、ないよ
甜花ちゃん……","Mhm, it didn't.
Tenka-chan..."
3016004030370,甘奈,もしかして、無理に甘奈のに合わせてたの……？,"Are you going out of your way to mimic what I'm 
making?"
3016004030380,甜花,"う、ううん！
なーちゃんの、すごく……かわいいから","N-No!
Naa-chan's stuffed bear... is super cute so..."
3016004030390,甜花,"なーちゃんみたいに、作ったら……
最高のクマ、できるって……思って……","I thought that if I made it like how Naa-chan's making 
it... I could also make... a wonderful stuffed bear..."
3016004030400,千雪,"そうね
甘奈ちゃんのは、きっと最高のクマさんになる","That's right.
Amana-chan's bear will surely turn out to be a 
wonderful one."
3016004030410,千雪,"でも、甜花ちゃんのもそうなのよ
甘奈ちゃんには作れない、甜花ちゃんのクマさん","But Tenka-chan, yours will also turn out great.
It'll be Tenka-chan's own stuffed bear, something 
that even Amana-chan can't make."
3016004030420,千雪,"お星さまと、おっきなボタン……
しましまの布もあったかしら？","We have the star pattern, and the large button...
Do we also have the striped cloth here?"
3016004030430,甜花,"あう……
か、買ったの……知ってたの……？","Awh...
You knew... That I bought it...?"
3016004030440,千雪,"ふふ、隠したのも知ってたわ
なぜなのかは、わからなかったけど","Fufu, I also know that you were hiding it.
I didn't know your reason for doing it though."
3016004030450,甘奈,"そうだったんだ……
甘奈も、あの星のやつのほうが好きだよ","So that's how it was...
Amana also likes the star pattern better, you know?"
3016004030460,甜花,な……なーちゃんも……？,N-Naa-chan too...?
3016004030470,甘奈,"うん、甜花ちゃんぽくて
すっごいかわいー！","Yup, it's super cute
and fits Tenka-chan a lot too!"
3016004030480,甜花,……,...
3016004030490,千雪,"甜花ちゃん、
隠したのを出してきて、好きに作ってみたらどうかしら","Tenka-chan, why don't you take out what you're 
hiding and try making it the way you want to?"
3016004030500,甜花,……う、うん……！,... O-Okay...!
3016004030510,千雪,"すごい、スイッチ入っちゃったのねえ
ほとんど完成じゃない！","Wow, you also put a switch huh.
It looks like it's mostly done!"
3016004030520,甜花,にへへ……,Nihehe...
3016004030530,甘奈,"へへー
甘奈と、鼻がお揃いなんだー","Heheー
It has the same nose as Amana's."
3016004030540,千雪,"うん、
すごくかわいいわ、ふたりとも！","Mhm,
both of your stuffed bears are super cute!"
3016004030550,甜花,"千雪さんは……
何……作ってるの……？","Chiyuki-san...
What... are you making...?"
3016004030560,甘奈,"うん、甘奈も聞きたい
それもクマさんでしょ……？","Yeah, Amana wanted to ask about that too.
That's a bear, right...?"
3016004030570,千雪,"これ？
ふふ、双子のクマさんを護る、騎士さんたち","These?
Fufu, they're knights that'll protect the twins' bears."
3016004030580,千雪,"最高のクマさんたちには、
お仕えするクマさんがいなきゃね","For the most wonderful bears, it's just right that 
they have loyal bear attendants too, right?"
3016004030590,千雪,"ふたりが作っている間にもう何体か……
って思ったんだけど……","While you two were making your stuffed bears,
I was thinking about what kind of shape they should 
take and..."
3016004030600,甘奈,"す……すごーい！
剣とかもある！","W-Wow...!
They have things like swords too!"
3016004030610,甜花,"千雪さん……ありがとう……
甜花、好きな布で作って……よかった……","Chiyuki-san... Thank you...
I'm glad that Tenka... was able to use the cloth 
she wanted to use..."
3016004030620,千雪,"ふふ
それなら、ほんとによかったわ","Fufu.
In that case, I'm really glad too."
3016004030630,甜花,"で……でも……
まだ、１匹……足りない……","B-But...
One... isn't enough..."
3016004030640,甘奈,うん、千雪さんがいないねー,"I agree, there isn't one for Chiyuki-san yet."
3016004030650,千雪,ええ？　ふたりの課題だから、私はいいのよ,"Huh? It was an assignment for both of you, so I'm 
fine."
3016004030660,甜花,な、なーちゃん……,N-Naa-chan...
3016004030670,甘奈,へへーわかってるよ、甜花ちゃん,"Hehe. I get it, Tenka-chan."
3016004030680,甜花,"うん……千雪さんのクマ……
て、甜花たちが……作るね……！","Yeah... Chiyuki-san's bear...
T-Tenka... will make it, okay...!"

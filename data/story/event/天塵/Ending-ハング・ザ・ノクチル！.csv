4001026080250,円香,"海に来たんだな……
みたいなことを思ってた","So we made it to the sea...
That's more or less what was going through my head, then."
4001026080260,円香,"花火がうるさくて
返しなんて全然聞こえなくて",The fireworks were so deafening. Couldn't hear the monitors at all.
4001026080270,円香,"客席とか、現実感なくて
ぼんやりしてた","You looked at the seating area in front of you, and there was no reality to it. I was just completely tuned out."

4001026080330,小糸,"誰も見てなかったけど
今度はみんな、ちゃんと歌ってたよね……？","No one was watching us at all, but this time, we were all singing properly, weren't we...?"

すごいことが起きそうって","And, you know, I was even thinking it. ""Something amazing's gonna happen""."
4001026080400,雛菜,そしたら、誰も見てなかった,"And when it did, nobody was even watching!"
4001026080410,雛菜,みんな、もったいないことしちゃったね？,"And that was all their loss, wasn't it?"

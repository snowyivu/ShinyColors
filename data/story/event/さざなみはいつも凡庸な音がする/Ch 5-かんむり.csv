4001040060010,雛菜,あ～…………,Ah～......
4001040060020,雛菜,雛菜もグー出せばよかった～……,Hinana should have just used rock...
4001040060030,雛菜,"どうせお掃除するなら
海がよかったのに～……","If we were to be cleaning either way, I'd rather be
doing it by the sea～..."
4001040060040,透,ふぁ……,*yawn*...
4001040060050,雛菜,"あは～
透先輩、眠い～？","Aha～
Sleepy? Toru-senpai～"
4001040060060,雛菜,今日すっごいあくびしてるよ～,You've been yawning a lot today～
4001040060070,透,"え？
あー",Eh? Ahhー
4001040060080,雛菜,"もしかして昨日
あんまり眠れなかった～？",Maybe you didn't have a good sleep last night～?
4001040060090,透,"え？
んー……",Eh? Yeaー...
4001040060100,雛菜,"そっか～
雛菜は電気消してすぐ寝ちゃった～","I see～ Hinana fell asleep right after the lights
switched off～"
4001040060110,透,ふふっ,Hehe.
4001040060120,透,そっか,I see.
4001040060130,円香,暑…………,It's hot......
4001040060140,小糸,"そ、そうだね
なんか全然まだ夏の暑さが続きそう……","I-It sure is.
Feels like the summer heat never left..."
4001040060150,小糸,ふぁ……,*yawn*...
4001040060160,小糸,"あ……
ご、ごめん、あくびしちゃった","Ah...
S-Sorry, I yawned."
4001040060170,円香,…………,......
4001040060180,円香,"……寝不足の時に炎天下にいるの
あんまりよくないんじゃない","...Being under the sun while lacking sleep isn't a good
idea."
4001040060190,小糸,そ、そうかな,I-I guess so.
4001040060200,小糸,"で、でも大丈夫だよ
寝不足ってほどじゃ……無いし","B-But I'm alright.
I'm not really lacking much... sleep."
4001040060210,小糸,"暑いけど、海風も気持ちいいし
全然……","Even though it's hot, the sea breeze feels good.
I'm totally fine..."
4001040060220,円香,"……ふうん
じゃあ頑張って","...Huh, I see.
Keep it up then, I'll be right back"
4001040060230,小糸,"え……あ
円香ちゃん……！","Eh... Hey.
Madoka-chan...!"
4001040060240,雛菜,"なんかこの箒、学校の
掃除当番の時みたいじゃない～？","All this sweeping, doesn't it make you feel like we're
doing cleaning duties in school～?"
4001040060250,透,あー……,Ahー...
4001040060260,雛菜,"じゃあ学校とやってること
あんまり変わらないね～","Then what we do here is not much different from
school, huh～"
4001040060270,透,……あ,...Ah.
4001040060280,雛菜,ん～？,Hm～?
4001040060290,透,"思い出した
回ってくる、今度","I just remembered.
It'll be my turn, next."
4001040060300,透,"掃除当番
外掃くやつ","Cleaning duties.
I'll be cleaning outside."
4001040060310,雛菜,"へ～
大変そう～……","Huh～
That sounds horrible～..."
4001040060320,透,"回ってくるよ、そのうち
雛菜にも","It'll rotate, eventually.
Hinana'll get it too."
4001040060330,円香,"──水もらったんだけど
小糸も飲む？","─I got us some water.
Wanna have some?"
4001040060340,円香,"持ちながらやっていいって
ゴミ拾い",You can pick up the rubbish while holding on to it.
4001040060350,小糸,"そ、そっか……！
ありがとう……！","O-Ok...!
Thank you...!"
4001040060360,小糸,"で、でも、あんまりゴミ
落ちてないよね……この海岸","B-But there isn't much rubbish on the beach...
is there."
4001040060370,円香,"お寺の人や近所の人が
ボランティアで掃除してるらしいから","Those from the temple and those living around
volunteer to help clean up."
4001040060380,円香,そこまでは汚れてないみたいだけど,"It doesn't seemed that dirty to me, though."
4001040060390,小糸,そ、そうなんだ……！,S-So that's how it is...!
4001040060400,円香,それでも、ひとつも無いわけじゃない,"But even with their volunteering, it's not like it's
completely spotless."
4001040060410,小糸,"あ……
ビニール袋…………","Ah...
A plastic bag..."
4001040060420,小糸,"これ、どこかから
流れてきたのかな……",That must have floated here from somewhere else...
4001040060430,円香,……さあ,...Who knows.
4001040060440,雛菜,"やは～！
なんか、すっごい綺麗になった気がする！",Yaha～! It feels super clean to me now!
4001040060450,透,"んー
グー","Yeaー
Guu."
4001040060460,雛菜,"うん～！
雛菜と透先輩が頑張ったからだね～","Yay～! That's because Toru-senpai and I worked hard
cleaning～"
4001040060470,透,ふふっ,Hehe.
4001040060480,透,"やばい
楽しいかも","Oh no.
This is starting to feel fun."
4001040060490,透,雛菜,Hinana.
4001040060500,雛菜,へ～？,Huh～?
4001040060510,透,"いいの？
海じゃなくて","Is it okay with you?
Not cleaning by the sea."
4001040060520,雛菜,あ～……,Ah～...
4001040060530,雛菜,"うん
海がよかったけど","Yeah. Even though it'll be nice to be by the sea,"
4001040060540,雛菜,"透先輩と話しながらだし
こっちもよかった！","I get to chat with Toru-senpai while cleaning, so it's
fine here too!"
4001040060550,透,おー,Wewー
4001040060560,雛菜,"雛菜、あんまり楽しくないことって無いから
大丈夫だよ～","There's nothing much that Hinana doesn't find fun,
so it's alright with me～"
4001040060570,雛菜,"本当に楽しくないことはしないもん
雛菜！","Hinana wouldn't do things I don't like in the first
place!"
4001040060580,雛菜,透先輩も知ってるでしょ～？,Toru-senpai knows that right～?
4001040060590,透,"んー
グー","Yeaー
Guu."
4001040060600,小糸,"わ、わたしも何か
見つけないと…………",I-I need to find some too...
4001040060610,円香,本当は見つからない方がいいんだけどね,It's actually better to not find any though.
4001040060620,小糸,"あ……そ、そっか
でも……","Ah...I-I see.
But..."
4001040060630,小糸,"…………
あ……！","......
Ah...!"
4001040060640,円香,……？,......?
4001040060650,小糸,"あそこ、今なんか……
光った気がする……","Over there, I see something...
I think I spot a shimmer..."
4001040060660,円香,どこ？,Where?
4001040060670,小糸,"そこの、砂の中……？
ガラス、とかかな……","Over there, under the sand...?
Maybe it's glass or something..."
4001040060680,小糸,あ…………,Ah......
4001040060690,円香,何？,What is it?
4001040060700,小糸,"お、王冠……
何かの、飲み物の","I-It's a bottle cap.
From a drink."
4001040060710,円香,ふうん……,Huh...
4001040060720,小糸,"う、うん……！
ほとんど、砂に埋まってたけど","I-It sure is...!
Although it's mostly buried in the sand."
4001040060730,小糸,……一瞬、光った気がして,...I felt its shimmer for a moment.
4001040060740,小糸,"見たこと無い英語のロゴだから
もしかしたら、外国のとかかな……？","It's a logo in English that I've never seen before.
Maybe it's a foreign drink...?"
4001040060750,円香,……わからない,...No idea.
4001040060760,円香,私たちが知らないだけかも,"Maybe we're the only one that doesn't know where
it's from."
4001040060770,雛菜,"あは～
お掃除完了～！",Aha～ Cleaning's done～!
4001040060780,透,"しゃー
お疲れ","Alrightー
Good job."
4001040060790,雛菜,"お疲れさま～
ね、透先輩は～？","Good job to you too～
Hey, Toru-senpai～?"
4001040060800,透,え？,Eh?
4001040060810,雛菜,"楽しかった？
雛菜と掃除～",Did you have fun? Cleaning with Hinana～
4001040060820,透,"ふふっ
なんで？","Hehe.
Why ask?"
4001040060830,雛菜,へ～？,Huh～?
4001040060840,雛菜,"だって、楽しくてしあわせな方がいいでしょ？
雛菜のすきな人は","Cos, it's better to be enjoying things right?
Hinana wants people she likes to be happy."
4001040060850,雛菜,"その方がしあわせだもん
雛菜が！",That makes Hinana happier!
4001040060860,透,おー,Ooohー
4001040060870,雛菜,"なんだ
知らなかった～？",Huh. You didn't know～?
4001040060880,小糸,"もう、あんまりゴミ
見当たらないね……！",I don't really see any rubbish left...!
4001040060890,円香,オッケー,Okay.
4001040060900,円香,"まあ、掃除なんかしなくても
もともと綺麗だったし","Well, even if we never cleaned at all. it was clean to
begin with."
4001040060910,小糸,"で、でもちょっとだけでも海、
綺麗になったならよかったな……","B-But, even if it's just a little, I'm glad that the sea
was cleaned...!"
4001040060920,小糸,"こういうのって、なんか
ちょっと気持ちがいいよね……！","Something like this, somehow, feels kinda nice,
doesn't it...!"
4001040060930,円香,……よかったね,...It does.
4001040060940,小糸,"あ……
だけど",Ah... But...
4001040060950,円香,ん？,Hm?
4001040060960,小糸,"た、ただゴミ拾いしてるだけで
多分、全然面白い場面、無かったよね……","W-We were just picking up rubbish, and there's
probably nothing very interesting about that..."
4001040060970,小糸,だ、大丈夫かな……,I-I wonder if it's going to be okay...
4001040060980,円香,…………,......
4001040060990,円香,……じゃ、どうするの？,"...Then, what should we have done?"
4001040061000,円香,"海も心も綺麗にしてこいって企画だし
間違ってはいないと思うけど","We were tasked to cleanse both the sea and our
minds so I don't think there's anything wrong with
that."
4001040061010,小糸,そ、そうかな……？,Y-You think so...?
4001040061020,円香,全然面白くはないけどね,"But you were right that it's completely
uninteresting, though."

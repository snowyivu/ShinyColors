4019001000130010,愛依,プロデューサー、今日のステージ、なんかまぶしくない？,"Producer, isn't today's stage kind of blinding?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（照明が気になるみたいだ）,(Seems like she's concerned about the lighting)
select,,じっと見て、慣らそう,"If you keep staring
you'll get used to it."
select,,調整、頼んでみる,"We could try to
ask them to adjust it."
select,,"変わらないと
思うけど","I don't think you can
change that though."
4019001000130020,愛依,"ま、それしかないよね～
サンキュ、ちょっと慣らしてくんね！","Well, I have no choice~
Thank you, I'll try to get used to it!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（不安要素を減らせたな）,(Her concern seems to have abated)
4019001000130030,愛依,"マジで？　あ～でも、迷惑になっちゃうっしょ？
気持ちだけもらっとくわ！　サンキュ！","For real? Ah, but isn't that bothersome?
Well I appreciate the thought! Thank you!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（とりあえず大丈夫そうかな）,(Well she seems okay for now)
4019001000130040,愛依,"え～、そんなもん？
絶対まぶしいと思うんだけど～","Eh? That's just life?
But they definitely seem blinding~"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（思った以上に気になっているみたいだ）,(She's more concerned than I thought)

0000000000000,プロデューサー,ああ、俺から見てもそう思うぞ,"Ahh, from my point of view I think she is."
1019001001510020,愛依,"うちもアイドルなんだし、
ちっとは見習ったほうがいいんかな～","Since I'm an Idol too,
I may have to follow her example a little~"

いいんじゃないか","Wouldn't she be
good to use as a
reference?"

いいんじゃないか","It's good to be
yourself, isn't it?"

try copying her clothes
and accessories."

冬優子ちゃんみたいな可愛いカンジ","Don't you think it's a good idea?
Fuyuko-chan has such a cute style."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（まぁ、普通に話せたかな）,"(Well, I guess that went OK.)"
1019001001510070,愛依,え～……うちには似合わないんじゃね？,Eh... don't you think it wouldn't really suit me?

似合うカンジだし？","Hey, that's Fuyuko-chan's style after all!
You feel it'd look good on me?"

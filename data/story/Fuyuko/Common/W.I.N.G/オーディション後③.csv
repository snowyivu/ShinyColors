さいっこーに気持ち良かった！",Ahー! That was the most wonderful feeling!
0000000000000,プロデューサー,うん、伸び伸びした良いステージだったぞ,"Yeah, it was a good, comfortable stage."
5018001000210020,冬優子,"好き勝手にパフォーマンスして褒められるなんて、
オーディションなんて楽なもんよね！","Being praised for performing how I like, auditions are

0000000000000,プロデューサー,"確かに、今の冬優子なら
どんなオーディションも突破できる……けど","Certainly, if you're performing as you are now you

ふゆのちっちゃいとこまで、ちゃんと見てるんでしょうね","...but, I was... also looking just a little bit, for you."

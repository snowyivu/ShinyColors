0000000000000,プロデューサー,冬優子、今大丈夫か？,"Are you feeling just fine, Fuyuko?"
1018001030010,冬優子,"もう、冬優子じゃなくて『ふゆ』ですよ♪
なんですか？　プロデューサーさんっ","How may times does Fuyu have to say it, it's ""Fuyu"" and not ""Fuyuko"".
What is it, Producer?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"この前、説明したとおり
今日の仕事は今までに比べてかなり大きい","As I explained it to you before, today's job is much bigger compared to the ones we did before."
1018001030020,冬優子,はい、いただいた企画書、いーっぱい読みました♪,Yes. And Fuyu read the details she received a lot of times to prepare for this.
1018001030030,冬優子,"ふゆも好きな雑誌の、ピンナップ……
うう、緊張しちゃいます～……！","To be the pinup girl of the magazine that even Fuyu is fond of...
Uuh, this makes Fuyu nervous..."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"ああ。それに何より、
今日のカメラマンはかなり厳しい人だ","Yes. And above else,
the cameraman for today is quite strict."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"でも、腕は間違いない
撮影を乗り越えれば、きっとステップアップになる","But, his skills is definitely top-notch.
If you're able to overcome this shoot, you'll definitely be able to step up."
1018001030040,冬優子,はい！　ふゆ……精いっぱい頑張りますね！,Yes! Fuyu... Fuyu will do her absolute best!
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"（うん、冬優子も気合入ってるみたいだな
今日の撮影も、きっと上手くいくはずだ！）","(Yes, seems like Fuyuko's all fired up for this too.
Today's shoot is sure to turn out well!)"
1018001030050,冬優子,こう、ですかっ？,Like this?
0000000000000,カメラマン,もっと自然に笑って。今のままじゃ固すぎるよ,You should smile more naturally. The ones you've been doing are too stilted.
1018001030060,冬優子,"す、すみません……
えっと、自然に……！","F-Fuyu's sorry about that...
Umm, more naturally..."
1018001030070,冬優子,こ、こうかな……,M-Maybe like this?
0000000000000,カメラマン,"ダメダメ
それじゃあ、さっきと変わらないよ","No.
It's not any different from before."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"（まずいな……
さっきから全然ＯＫが出ていない……）","(This is bad.
The cameraman hasn't given his approval at all.)"
1018001030080,冬優子,あの、うまくできなくて、すみません……,"Umm, Fuyu's really sorry that she hasn't done it right..."
0000000000000,カメラマン,……君は笑顔を作るのは上手いよ,You're good in putting on a smile.
0000000000000,カメラマン,"でも、それはしょせん作り物だ
君の笑顔は本物じゃない","But, that's still a made-up smile in the end.
Your smiling isn't genuine."
1018001030090,冬優子,！,!
0000000000000,カメラマン,まあ、それでも何枚かはマシなものが撮れたからね,"Well, that doesn't change the fact that we did have some decent ones."
0000000000000,カメラマン,満足とは程遠いけど、これで切り上げよう,"While I'm far from satisfied, let's wrap this up and call it a day."
1018001030100,冬優子,…………,......
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"冬優子、落ち込むことはない
緊張してただろうし、まだ仕事に不慣れなだけで──","Fuyuko, don't let it get to you.
You were probably just nervous and not really used in doing this so…"
1018001030110,冬優子,……不慣れだから、本物の笑顔が作れないって？,"I'm not used in doing it which is why I can't show a genuine smile, is that what you're saying?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,え？,Huh?
1018001030120,冬優子,"何が本物の笑顔よ！
んなもん知らないわよ！","The heck is this ""genuine smile"" thing!
As if I know that!"
1018001030130,冬優子,"こっちはちゃんと仕事してんのに
ワケわかんないこと言うなっての！",Here I am earnestly working and then I got thrown some vague stuff!
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"……ど、どうした？
いつもの冬優子らしくないぞ","W-What's gotten into you?
You don't seem to be acting like your usual self."
1018001030140,冬優子,"何よ、いつものふゆって！
あんたがふゆの何を知ってんの！？","What do you mean my usual self?
What do you even know about me!"
1018001030150,冬優子,"ほんとの顔……ほんとの笑顔……
それのどこがいいの！","Your real self, your genuine smile.
What's the good with that!"
1018001030160,冬優子,"ほんとのふゆを知ったら
みんな嫌いになるくせに！！","If everyone knows the real me, then they'll all just hate me!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,冬優子、落ち着け！,"Calm down, Fuyuko!"
1018001030170,冬優子,……あ……,Ah...
1018001030180,冬優子,"……はっ、どうしたの？
これがほんとのふゆ……だけど？　お望みのね","Haa... What's the matter?
This is what I really am. That's what you all want, right?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,冬優子……,Fuyuko...
1018001030190,冬優子,"ほら、やっぱりそーゆー顔する
ほんとの顔なんて見せたら、みんなふゆを嫌いになるんだ","See? I know you'd make that face.
If I show my real self, everyone would hate me."
1018001030200,冬優子,……笑っちゃうわ,"Funny, isn't..."
1018001030210,冬優子,"ほら、
あんたも、ふゆに幻滅したでしょ？","Admit it.
You too got disillusioned with me, didn't you?"
select,,"アイドルの仕事は
つまらなかったか？",Was idol work boring?
select,,"今見せてるのは
本当の冬優子か？",Did you just show what the true Fuyuko is?
select,,"そうじゃないかと
思ってた",That's not what I've been thinking
1018001030220,冬優子,はあ？　何か関係あるわけ？,Huh? What does that get to do with this?
1018001030230,冬優子,"…………
私は、別に……",Not that I care　much about it...
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"冬優子は仕事の時、
いつも楽しそうにしているように見えた",I always see you enjoying yourself while working.
1018001030240,冬優子,"そりゃそうよ！
そういうふうにお芝居してたんだから","Of course you would!
It exactly because I'm acting that way!"
1018001030250,冬優子,"あ～あ
アイドルなんて適当に笑ってればいいと思ったら","Haa
And here I thought all I have to do to be an idol is smile."
1018001030260,冬優子,"意外と面倒なのね
……もう、飽きちゃった","But it's actually quite a handful.
...I'm tired of all these."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,冬優子……,Fuyuko...
1018001030270,冬優子,な、なんなの、その眼は！,W-Why are you looking at me like that!?
0000000000000,プロデューサー,…………,......
1018001030280,冬優子,"……もういい！
あんたなんて知らない！","I've had enough!
I don't care about you any more!"
1018001030290,冬優子,"そうだっつってんでしょ！
アイドルだって、ほんとはたいして興味ないの！","I already told you that already!
I'm not even that interest in becoming an idol!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,……そうか,I see.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"でも、アイドルに興味ないってその言葉、
冬優子が心から思っているものだとは思えないよ","But, I don't think that your words reflect what your heart really feels."
1018001030300,冬優子,っ……,......
1018001030310,冬優子,"……とにかく！　これがほんとのふゆだから！
ふゆがアイドルになるなんて、無理なのよ","Anyways! This is what I really am!
There's no way that I could ever become an idol!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,……俺はそうは思わない,I don't think so.
1018001030320,冬優子,"……ふん
口だけならどうとでも言えるわよ","Hmph.
It's all too easy for you to say that."
1018001030330,冬優子,…………期待しちゃったの、バカみたい,"How stupid, getting my hopes up like that..."
1018001030340,冬優子,"はっ……
何それ、負け惜しみのつもり？","Haa...
What's that? Trying to come up with some excuse?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"……冬優子はいつも、
何を言われてもにこにこ笑ってるだけだっただろ",You were always smiling no matter has been said to you.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"でも、本当はもっと熱いものを
内に秘めているんじゃないかって感じてたんだ","But, I felt that, maybe, there's actually something warm hiding inside you."
1018001030350,冬優子,っ！,!
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"今の冬優子を見て……
冬優子の魅力に気づいたよ",Looking at you right now... I just noticed this charm to you.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"まっすぐに気持ちをぶつける姿勢とその目……
きっと冬優子の武器になる","Your attitude now of just saying your feelings straight and those eyes of yours.
I'm sure that you could make great use of them."
1018001030360,冬優子,"……はあ？　何それ
適当なことばっか並べないでよ！","Huh? What's with that?
Don't just throw vague statements so mindlessly!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"適当なんかじゃない
俺は、本当に──","I'm not being vague here.
I'm actually…"
1018001030370,冬優子,"うっさい！
ほんとのふゆに魅力なんてないんだから！","Shut up!
The real me doesn't have any charm at all!"
1018001030380,冬優子,"だって……
こうでもしなかったら……ふゆは……","After all...
If I didn't do this... I..."

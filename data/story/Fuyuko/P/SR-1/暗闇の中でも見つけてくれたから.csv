2018003110010,冬優子,～♪,Hmhm~♪
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"ソロステージお疲れ様
ずいぶんご機嫌だな","Nice work on that solo stage.
You seem to be quite in a good mood."
2018003110020,冬優子,"だって今日のふゆ、絶好調なんだもん！
最高のパフォーマンスができちゃった！","Well, Fuyu is in top form today! Which is why I was able to put on such an awesome performance!"
2018003110030,冬優子,"ね、どうだった？
ふゆのステージ！","So, what did you
think of Fuyu's stage?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,もちろん、よかったぞ,"Of course, I found it to be great."
2018003110040,冬優子,"ほんと？
今日出てた他のアイドルの誰より！？","Really?
Even greater than the other idols who performed today?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"ああ
間違いなく、冬優子が一番だよ","Yeah...
There's no doubt about it, you were the best among them all."
2018003110050,冬優子,"やっぱり！？
あんたもそう思う！？","Really!?
You really think so!?"
2018003110060,冬優子,ふゆが……一番……,I am... the best...
2018003110070,冬優子,一番……あははっ,The best... Ahaha...
2018003110080,冬優子,……ね、もうひとつ質問させてくれる？,"Say, is it alright if I ask you another question?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,ん、なんだ？,Hmm? what is it?
2018003110090,冬優子,あんたにとって、ふゆは一番のアイドル？,Am I the best idol for you?
0000000000000,プロデューサー,それは今答えたんじゃ……？,Didn't I already answer that...?
2018003110100,冬優子,"さっきのあんたは、『プロデューサー』として、
ファンとかみんなの気持ちを代弁してたでしょ","You were acting as a ""Producer"" and speaking on behalf of the fans earlier,"
2018003110110,冬優子,"それくらい、
ふゆにもわかるわよ","Weren't you?
I know that much..."
2018003110120,冬優子,"でも、今聞きたいのはそういうのじゃない
みんながふゆをどう思ったかとかじゃなくて……","But, that's not what I want to hear from you right now.
Not what people think of Fuyu..."
2018003110130,冬優子,ふゆは、『あんた』がどう思ったか、聞きたいの,I want to hear your very own thoughts about me.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,……そんなの、最初から決まってる,"Well, it's quite obvious right from the start..."
2018003110140,冬優子,最初から……？,Right from the start?
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"ああ、スカウトをした時……
冬優子をひと目見た時からだ","Yes, when I scouted you... On the first moment that I laid my eyes on you."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"俺は冬優子の、
最初のファンなんだからな","After all,
I am your very first fan."
2018003110150,冬優子,"……そっか
……そうなんだ……","I see...
So, that's how it was..."
2018003110160,冬優子,"まぁ、トーゼンよね！
だって、ふゆだもん！","Well, obviously!
It is me, we're talking about!"
2018003110170,冬優子,"むしろ、
ふゆの最初のファンになれたこと、光栄に思うべきね！","Or rather, you really should feel honored
that you were my first fan!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,はは、そうだな,"Haha, right."
2018003110180,冬優子,……ふふ,Heheh...
2018003110190,冬優子,"でも……
ふゆはこんなとこで終わりじゃないの","However...
I wouldn't stop here."
2018003110200,冬優子,"これから、もっともっと、
もーっとすごいアイドルになるんだから！","I'm going to become an even much
greater idol than I am right now!"
2018003110210,冬優子,"日本一、世界一……
ううん、それよりもっと！","The best in Japan, the best in the whole world... No, even more wonderful than those two!"
2018003110220,冬優子,一瞬だって止まってやらないんだから！,"And I'm not going to let myself stop, not even for a moment!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"それじゃあ俺も、
置いてかれないように頑張らないとな","Which means, I should work hard so
as not to get left behind."
2018003110230,冬優子,"もちろん！
ふゆがトップになるまで、ちゃんとサポートすること！","You should! And until I reach the top,
you better support me properly!"
2018003110240,冬優子,"だから……ずっとずっと、
ふゆから目を離さないでよね、プロデューサー！","Which is why... you should never ever
take your eyes off me, Producer!"

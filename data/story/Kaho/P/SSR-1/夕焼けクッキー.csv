0000000000000,プロデューサー,どうかしたのか？,"What's the matter? "
2009004040220,果穂,"学校で焼きたてを味見したんですけど……
なんだか……ちょっとちがう感じがします","At school they tasted freshly made, but for some reason they taste different now..."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"それは多分……焼きたてと今とで
食感が違うんだろうな"," It's probably because the texture is different from when it was made fresh than it is now. "
2009004040230,果穂,そうなんですか？,Really?
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"ああ。冷めてサクサク感が増したんじゃないかな
甘さだけじゃなくて、歯応えもあってうまいぞ","Ah. When the cookies cooled down they got more crisper, so not only are they sweet but also chewy."
2009004040240,果穂,"はい！
それなら良かったですっ！","Yeah! that's really good! "
2009004040250,果穂,"でも、学校で食べた焼きたてでほくほくなクッキーも
スゴく美味しかったんです！",Though the freshly baked cookies I ate at school were really delicious!
2009004040260,果穂,"だからあたし……いつか焼きたても
プロデューサーさんに食べてもらいたいですっ！","That's why next time I make fresh cookies at school I want to give them to Producer so he can eat some! "
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"はは、そっか
話を聞いてたら、焼きたても食べたくなってきたな","Haha, that's good to hear. I would like to eat your cookies when they are freshly baked too. 
"
2009004040270,果穂,"はいっ！　あたし、頑張って作りますっ！
だから楽しみに待っててくださいっ","Sure! I'll do my best to make more! So I hope you will look forword to it! "

チョコやナッツを入れたんです！","You really wanna know!? I wanted the cookies to have a bunch of different flavors so I put chocolate and nuts inside! 
"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"なるほど……
うん、それぞれに違う美味しさがあっていいな","I see... Yes, they all seem to have a different taste to them. "
2009004040290,果穂,"同じ生地でも色んな味にできるから
作ってて面白かったです"," It was really interesting because you could make a lot of different flavors with the same batter. "
2009004040300,果穂,"お菓子って……食べるだけじゃなくて
作るのも楽しいんですねっ！","It's not just only fun to eat sweets but making them is also really enjoyable!  "
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"はは、果穂はすっかりお菓子作りに

0000000000000,プロデューサー,"そうだな……やってみるか！

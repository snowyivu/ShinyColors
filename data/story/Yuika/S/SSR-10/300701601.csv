0000000000000,結華のファン,────推し、リッチな仕事をしてほしい,────I want them to be doing some kind of fancy work.
0000000000000,霧子のファン,……というと？,...Like what?
0000000000000,結華のファン,"この子たちは事務所や世間からちゃんと
お金をかけてもらえるんだな～～～～って実感したい","Something that makes it look like the entire industry
or the whole world sunk a lot of money into them,
I feel like."
0000000000000,恋鐘のファン,わかる！！！！,"Oh, I totally get you!!!"
0000000000000,恋鐘のファン,"華やかな衣装……！
景気がよさそうなロケ地……！","Like, all the funding into gorgeous costumes...!
Or paying for trips to the most luxurious of places...!"
0000000000000,摩美々のファン,あー,Exactly.
0000000000000,咲耶のファン,"まぁうちは恵まれてる方だけど、欲望は尽きないよね
最高のアンティーカを無限に見たいし世間に知らしめたい","Even an endless supply of that wouldn't satiate me.
The world should infinitely witness the best that
L'Antica has to offer."
0000000000000,ファンたち,ねー！,True that!
3007016010001,一同,…………,......
3007016010010,結華,……確定？,...I guess that confirms it?
3007016010020,摩美々,アンティーカって言ってたしー,"Yeah, they definitely said ""L'Antica."""
3007016010030,咲耶,……グッズも持ってくれているようだ,Looks like they brought our merch with them too.
3007016010040,霧子,わ……,Wow...
3007016010050,恋鐘,うちらのファン……！,Look at 'em go...!
0000000000000,咲耶のファン,"やっぱりビジュアルで殴ってきてほしい
一番の希望はそこ","I want them to knock me out with how hot they look
That's all I ask."
0000000000000,咲耶のファン,これでもかってぐらい天賦の才を見せつけてほしい,"And it's not like I'm asking for a lot either.
They're the real deal, and they always deliver."
0000000000000,摩美々のファン,そろそろ強めの新規画欲しいよねー,I'd like for something like that to show up soon.
3007016010060,結華,強めの新規画、近々出るよー……！,"Oh, you bet it's coming up soon...!"
3007016010070,咲耶,こら結華,"Shh, Yuika."
3007016010080,霧子,ふふ……,Fufu...
3007016010090,摩美々,……気づかれる前に出るー？,...Should we head out before they notice us?
3007016010100,恋鐘,"そ、そうやね……
うちはちょっと、声かけたかばってん……","Maybe, but I was wonderin' if we should holler
at 'em on our way out or not..."
3007016010110,咲耶,……ああ、悩ましいね,"...Yeah, it's quite the dilemma."
3007016010120,咲耶,"声はかけたいけれど、
他のお客さんの迷惑になってしまってはいけない","While I would like to sit down and chat with them,
I wouldn't want to trouble the other diners with
a commotion."
3007016010130,摩美々,……,......
3007016010140,結華,"本人に自分たちの会話聞かれてた、って
あとから気づくいたたまれなさとかもね……あると思うし","I get the feeling that they'll feel super awkward if
they found out we've overheard them."
3007016010150,結華,"出るなら出ちゃった方が──
ああでも注文……！","So if we're gonna go, then we might as well do it
now── Oh wait, but our order...!"
3007016010160,咲耶,"ああ……！
そちらを残していくのも迷惑か……！","Oh my...! Now that would also spell trouble
if we leave that behind...!"
3007016010170,咲耶,"──では、こう……！
お店に迷惑がかからない形で……！","──So why don't we move that way?
So that the server can still give us our order...!"
3007016010180,恋鐘,"どがんしよう……？
なんかした方がよかやろか……？","Like how...?
What about our fans over there...?"
3007016010190,咲耶,"まずは、気づいても静かにしていてもらえるよう
合図を送るとか？","If they notice us, perhaps we can gesture to them
to stay quiet. Now how should we go about that?"
3007016010200,霧子,『しー』……？,Shhh... Like that...?
3007016010210,咲耶,"フフッ、ああ
『しー』","Heheh, sure.
Shhh!"
3007016010220,結華,──いや却下却下ぁ,"──No, we can't do that!"
3007016010221,咲耶＆霧子,……！,...!
3007016010230,結華,"逆に威力の高い爆弾落としてどうするの
急にさくやんときりりんと目が合ったと思ったらさぁ","We can't just toss a grenade like that so casually!
If the two of you look into their eyes and go..."
3007016010240,結華,『しー』……,"""Shhh""..."
3007016010250,結華,"とかされてごらんよ。どうなると思う？
ファンサしたあとの自分のファンの反応思い出して","What do you think's gonna happen? Think back
to how our fans react to fanservice like that."
3007016010260,摩美々,あまりの感動に言葉を失って静かになるー,"I can see them getting all starry-eyed and saying
nothing."
3007016010270,結華,"そっちのパターンもあるけども！
『キャー！？』ってなるじゃん？　普通！","Well, that's one of the possibilities!
But they usually go all ""kyaa"", don't they?"
3007016010280,恋鐘,"そいが無理やったら～
目の合った時に手ば振るともいけん……？","If that's no good, then we can just wave at 'em
when they see us movin' seats...?"
3007016010290,霧子,そうかも……,I guess...
3007016010300,結華,"席と席でやりとりするんじゃなくて
近づいてたらワンチャン……？","If we're moving seats anyway, don't you think this
is a good chance to sit closer to where they are?"
3007016010310,結華,"『ワッ』っとなっちゃったら
『静かに！』って直接お願いできるし……？","If they do freak out, then we can just ask
them to keep it down, right...?"
3007016010320,咲耶,ふむ、そうだね,"Hum, yeah that should do it."
3007016010330,咲耶,"せっかくの機会だから、
近くで顔をよく見て話せた方が私も嬉しい","It's a worth a shot. I'm more than glad to
speak to them face-to-face."
3007016010340,結華,じゃあ課題はどうやって違和感なく近づくか、か……,"Now all that's left is finding the optimal
way to approach them..."
3007016010350,結華,"５人で向こうの席まで移動してくのって
正直不自然だもんね……","Honestly, it'll look out of place if all five of us move
tables...."
3007016010360,結華,"だったら出がけに挨拶の方がいいかな？
ああでもそれだと前提が──","So maybe we can say ""hi"" before we move?
Hmm, but that's assuming──"
3007016010370,摩美々,……,......
3007016010380,摩美々,今の私たちって相当自意識過剰だしー,I think we're really overthinking this situation...
3007016010390,摩美々,"この瞬間に気づかれるのが
一番ダサいよねー","If they notice us right now as we're fussing over
this, we would seem super lame."
3007016010391,一同,…………！,...!
3007016010400,摩美々,特に三峰ー,"And Mitsumine, you'd seem lamest of all~"
3007016010410,結華,"まみみんそれはさ……！
気づいてもそっとしておいてよ……！","Mamimin! Don't bring it up!
You're going to jinx it!"
3007016010420,摩美々,えー？,Hmmm~?
3007016010430,結華,"三峰だってわかってたけど、
わかってたけど頑張って考えてたんだから……！","Mitsumine's aware of the impending doom too!
That's why I'm trying hard not to let that happen...!"
3007016010440,摩美々,"ふふー
ファンとお店のこと優先して考えてて偉い偉いー","Fufu~ Well it's great you're trying so hard for the
fans and the restaurant staff. I've got a gold star
just for you~"
3007016010450,結華,くっ……！,Geh...!
0000000000000,店員,"お待たせいたしました！
デザートセットです","Thank you for waiting!
Your dessert set is ready."
3007016010451,一同,！,!
0000000000000,店員,残りもすぐお持ちします！,We will bring out the rest shortly!
3007016010460,結華,ありがとうございまーす……！,Thank you!
3007016010470,結華,……と、とりあえずは,...A-Anyways.
3007016010480,結華,見つからないよう静かに食べながら、作戦会議継続で……！,"Let's just eat this up quietly so that they don't
catch us. But that doesn't mean this meeting is
over! Let's come up with something while we eat."
3007016010481,一同,……！,......!

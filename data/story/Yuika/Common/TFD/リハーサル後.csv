6007002020010,結華,"プロデューサーお疲れ様
ねぇ、この先も全体練習って取りづらいんだっけ？","I'm back, Producer. So hey, do you think it'll
be tough having us practice together again?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"お、お疲れ様
そうだな……それぞれ別の仕事が詰まってて──","Welcome back.
Uh, yeah... Everyone's booked with lots of stuff."
6007002020020,結華,そっか,I see.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,すまん……,Sorry about that...
6007002020030,結華,──いや、こっちこそごめんね,"──No, that's on me."
6007002020040,結華,"やっぱ５人揃うと違うなぁって思ったからさ、
集まりたくなっちゃって","I was thinking that it may be different if
the five of us are practicing together."
6007002020050,結華,"ひとりの時も、みんなのこと想像しながら
練習してたつもりだったけど","Because when I practice alone, I always
imagine them being there with me."
6007002020060,結華,"やっぱり本物は違うんだよね
足し算じゃなくてかけ算なの","Turns out I was right. Practicing with them
for real made a whole lot of difference.
Like... magnitudes."

6007002020070,結華,えー、何それ？　愚問でしょＰたん,"Wha, why are you asking that?
That's a silly question, P-tan."
6007002020080,結華,"三峰がつまんないところでじっとしてると思う？
それくらいわかってもらわないと！","Do you think that Mitsumine would stick around for
something boring? You could at least understand
THAT much!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"そうだよな。……よし、スケジュール、
調整できるところがないか見てみるよ","That's true. Okay, about the schedule...
I'll see if there's anything I can move around."
6007002020090,結華,"さっすがプロデューサー！
話がわかるし仕事がデキる～！","Producer's on point as always!
So understanding... And good at his job～!"
6007002020100,結華,──よろしくね、頼りにしてるから,"──I'm glad we're in good hands.
I'm counting on you."

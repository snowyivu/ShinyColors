0000000000000,プロデューサー,"結華、お疲れ様
今日の収録はどうだった？","Good work, Yuika.
How did you feel about today's shoot?"
6007001000110010,結華,"えへへー！　楽しかったよ！
今までテレビで見てた世界に飛び込んだ感じでさぁ","Eheheh! It was awesome!
It's cool being plunged into the same world of TV
I watch at home."
6007001000110020,結華,"でもね、正直なところ、
三峰まだまだ改善点が多かった……！","Though, to be honest! Mitsumine still has a lot of
areas she needs to improve on...!"
6007001000110030,結華,"カメラあると動き固くなっちゃうし、目線向けるのも
頭使わなきゃだし、笑顔強張りそうだったし！","I move all stiff when there's a camera, and it's a lot
of effort not to look right at it! I think my smile was
forced, too!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"そうか、なるほど
終わってすぐ反省ができているのは大事なことだな","Oh, I see. It's impressive that you can reflect on all
that as soon as you finish."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"……でも、それだけか？
俺は良かったと思ったところ、いっぱいあるぞ","...Though, were those the only problems you had?
I thought the majority of it was really good."
6007001000110040,結華,"……Ｐたんったら、三峰の判定甘めじゃない？　
そんなんじゃ調子に乗っちゃうよ？","...Aren't you going a little too easy on me, P-tan?
You don't want Mitsumine to get to slack off, do
you?"
6007001000110050,結華,"でも……そうだね
結構頑張った！　し、上手くいった！　と思う！","But... You're right.
I did try my best! And, I think! It went well!"
6007001000110060,結華,これもプロデューサーのおかげだよ、ありがとね！,"This is all thanks to you, Producer!"

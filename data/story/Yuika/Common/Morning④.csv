0000000000000,プロデューサー,お、このアイドル、最近よくテレビで見るよな,"Oh, that idol's been on TV a lot recently."
1007001000410010,結華,"そうだね、でも活動自体は意外と長いんだよ？
三峰も前から応援してるんだー","I know right! She's actually been on the scene for quite a while, though? Mitsumine's been cheering her since before she got big."
1007001000410020,結華,"トークも上手いし、いろんな仕事こなせちゃうし
やっぱり経験値が違うって感じ","She's a talented speaker, and has done a lot of other kinds of work to boot. She's racked up a lot of experience. "
0000000000000,プロデューサー,そんなことまで知ってるなんて……,"If you know that much, then..."
select,,でも俺の方が詳しいな,"I bet I know
more about her
than you do."
select,,ライバルだもんな,"She's one of 
your rivals now."
select,,よく調べてるな,"I see you've
done a lot of
research."
1007001000410030,結華,"お、プロデューサー、いいねその自信
もしかして勝負がご所望かな？","Woah, I like that confidence, Producer.
Perhaps you'd like to settle this with a trivia battle?"
1007001000410040,結華,この子についてどっちが詳しいか、決めちゃう？,"Is it time for us to determine who knows more about this idol, once and for all?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（よし、楽しく話せたな）,"(Nice, that went really well.)"
1007001000410050,結華,なるほど。……今はたしかにそうかもね,"Oh, yeah... Since I'm an idol now, I guess that's true."
1007001000410060,結華,"でもアイドルになりたての三峰じゃ、
まだまだ差は大きいと思うよ","Though, a veteran like her and a newbie like Mitsumine are on totally different playing fields. "
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（まぁ、普通に話せたかな）,"(Well, I guess that went OK.)"
1007001000410070,結華,"ざぁんねん、調べてるんじゃないよー
好きだから情報が集まるだけ","You've got it all wrong, I don't know that stuff that because of ""research""! It's because I like her."
1007001000410080,結華,"これがファンってものだよ
覚えといてね、プロデューサー","It's an important part of being idol's fan.
Make sure you remember that, Producer."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（うっ……しまった。別のことを言えば良かったな……）,(Ah… I should've said something else instead…)

やっぱり経験値が違うって感じ","She's a talented speaker. and done a lot of other kinds of work to boot. She's racked up a lot of experience. "
0000000000000,プロデューサー,そんなことまで知ってるなんて……,"If you know that much, then..."
select,,でも俺の方が詳しいな,"I bet I know
more about her

もしかして勝負がご所望かな？","Woah, I like that confidence, Producer.

1007001000410060,結華,"でもアイドルになりたての三峰じゃ、
まだまだ差は大きいと思うよ","Though, a veteran like her and a newbie like Mitsumine are on totally different playing fields. "
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（まぁ、普通に話せたかな）,"(Well, I guess that went OK.)"
1007001000410070,結華,"ざぁんねん、調べてるんじゃないよー
好きだから情報が集まるだけ","You've got it all wrong, I don't know that stuff that because of ""research""! It's because I like her."
1007001000410080,結華,"これがファンってものだよ
覚えといてね、プロデューサー","It's an important part of being idol's fan.
Make sure you remember that, Producer."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（うっ……しまった。別のことを言えば良かったな……）,(Uh-oh... I screwed up. I should have said something else...)

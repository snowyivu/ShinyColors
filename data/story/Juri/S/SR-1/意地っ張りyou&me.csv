3011003020010,樹里,"お、夏葉
お前も来てたのか","Oh, Natsuha.
You're here already."
3011003020020,夏葉,"ええ、ちょうどジョギングから
帰って来たところよ",Yeah. I just came back from a jog.
3011003020030,樹里,"なんだ、また走ってたのか？
あいかわらず、よくやるな","What, you've been running again?
Doing too much as usual."
3011003020040,夏葉,"ふふ、なんだか走るのが楽しくて
アナタとのジョギングのお陰かしら","Hehe, running has been pretty fun.
Thanks to the time I jogged with you, perhaps."
3011003020050,樹里,"……まぁ、やる気になったのは
良かったけどよ","...Well, glad to hear that you're motivated."
3011003020060,樹里,あの後、帰りがほんとに大変だったからな……,It was rough coming home after that day...
3011003020070,夏葉,ええ、そうね……,"Yeah, it was..."
3011003020080,夏葉,"何も考えずに走り続けて、
帰り道も覚えていなかったせいとは言え、ね","We ran without thinking, and ended up getting lost on
the way home."
3011003020090,樹里,"道を聞こうにも人がいねぇから、
あっちだこっちだ言いながら、道を探して……","There wasn't anyone else there to show the way, 
so we scrambled all over the place looking for
directions..."
3011003020100,樹里,"ったく、この年で迷子になるとは
思わなかったよ","Jeez, didn't think I'd still get lost at this age."
3011003020110,夏葉,"本当ね。迷子になった理由も
樹里を追い抜くのに夢中になったせいだもの","Right. And I got lost because I was only concerned
with overtaking you."
3011003020120,樹里,"次の日は次の日で、
筋肉痛でレッスンが大変だったしよ","The next day, my muscles were so sore I had a hard
time at training lessons."
3011003020130,夏葉,"あら、それは鍛え方が足りないのよ
私は普段から鍛えてるから、どうってことなかったわ","Oh my, that means you don't work out enough.
I work out all the time, so I was fine."
3011003020140,樹里,そういう夏葉も痛そうにしてただろ,"Nah, you looked like you were in pain."
3011003020150,夏葉,してない！,I wasn't!
3011003020160,樹里,"い－や、たまに痛そうに
顔をしかめてただろ",Don't lie. I saw you frowning in pain sometimes.
3011003020170,夏葉,……してない,...I wasn't.
3011003020180,樹里,"ははっ
夏葉って、結構意地っ張りだよな","Haha.
Natsuha, you really are stubborn."
3011003020190,夏葉,"……事実を言ってるだけよ
日々の鍛錬は欠かしてないから","I'm just telling the truth.
I never miss my daily workout."
3011003020200,夏葉,アナタも普段から運動した方がいいわよ？,How about you exercise on a regular basis too?
3011003020210,樹里,だから運動してるっての,I already told you I do work out.
3011003020220,樹里,"あの日はウォ－ミングアップを
ちゃんとやらなかったせいだ",I simply didn't warm up properly that day.
3011003020230,夏葉,ま、そういうことにしておくわ,Alright. I'll give that to you.
3011003020240,樹里,"……あれ
そういや、なんで走ることになったんだっけ","...Huh.
Come to think about it, why were we running to begin
with?"
3011003020250,夏葉,"さぁ……どうだったかしら
覚えてないわね","Hm... I'm not sure.
I don't remember why."
3011003020260,夏葉,"あの高台の綺麗な景色は、
よく覚えてるんだけどね","I remember that beautiful view from the hill very
well, though."
3011003020270,樹里,"そうだな。あれで一気に
いろんなことがどうでもよくなった気がする",Yeah. Nothing mattered anymore once I saw that.
3011003020280,夏葉,"先に着いた私が景色に目を奪われていたら
アナタが追い付いてきたのよね","I got there first and was lost in the scenery when
you caught up with me."
3011003020290,樹里,"ん？　ちょっと待て
おかしくね？","Huh? Wait a sec.
That's not it."
3011003020300,夏葉,何が？,What's wrong?
3011003020310,樹里,最初に着いたのはアタシだったろ？,I was the first one to get there.
3011003020320,夏葉,"何言ってるの？
私の方が間違いなく早く着いたわ","What are you talking about?
I definitely got there first. "
3011003020330,樹里,だから、それはアンタの勘違いだっての！,"I'm telling you, you got that wrong!"
3011003020340,樹里,"そんなに言うならもう一回
ジョギングで勝負すっか！？","If you're so sure,
how about another race!?"
3011003020350,夏葉,"望むところよ
わざわざ連敗したいだなんて、アナタも変わり者ね","Bring it on.
You're an odd one, going out of your way just to keep
your losing streak going."
3011003020360,樹里,よ－し、やってやろ－じゃね－か！,"Okay, let's do it then!"
3011003020370,夏葉,"いつでもいいわよ
私はいつでもベストコンディションだから","Whenever you please.
I'm always in my best condition."
3011003020380,樹里,"言うじゃね－か
負けた後で言い訳すんなよ？","If you said so.
Don't make excuses after you lose, yeah?"
3011003020390,樹里,……ははっ,...Haha.
3011003020400,夏葉,……ふふっ,...Hehe.
3011003020410,樹里,"あ－あ、ほんとアタシたち
子どもみたいだな","Man, we're just like children."
3011003020420,夏葉,ええ、そうね,"Yes, we are."
3011003020430,樹里,"……なあ、今度また走らないか？
勝負は抜きで","...Hey, you wanna go for another run sometime?
No competition."
3011003020440,夏葉,"ええ、付き合ってあげてもいいわ
いつなら空いてるかしら？","Sure. I'd be love to accompany you.
When is a good time?"
3011003020450,樹里,"そうだな……
今度の休みなんかどうだ？","Let's see...
How about the next day off?"
3011003020460,夏葉,"ええ、いいわよ
目的地はまたあの高台でいいわよね？","Sure thing.
How about we race to that hill again?"
3011003020470,樹里,"ああ
またあの風景が見れるなら悪くねぇな","Yeah.
Seeing that view again doesn't sound too bad."
3011003020480,夏葉,ふふ、楽しみにしておくわ,"Hehe, I'll look forward to it."

3011009020030,智代子,タイムスケジュール……,In my life like...
3011009020040,樹里,"あーなんだろうな、朝起きてー
学校行ってー、終わったら事務所来てー……","Let me think. I guess I wake up, go to school, and
afterwards I come to the office..."
3011009020050,智代子,"はい！　質問！
寮の朝ってどんな感じなの？","Alright, next question!
How are the mornings in the dorms?"
3011009020060,樹里,"や、別に普通だけど……
な？　凛世","Well, I don't think it's anything special or anything.
Right, Rinze?"
3011009020070,凛世,はい……,Indeed...
3011009020080,智代子,そうなんだ……！？,I see...
3011009020090,智代子,"てっきり、洗面所が混み合ってバタバタしたりとか、
毎朝そういうドラマがあるんだと思ってた……！","But, the bathroom is super packed in the morning
though. Like I even thought that a fight would break
out there at one point!"
3011009020100,智代子,"──でも、寮でも変わらないんだっていうのも、
きっと知りたい情報だよね","Even if the dorms aren't anything special, I'm sure
there are other things people would like to know."
3011009020110,凛世,"では……
詳しめに……書きましょう……","In that case...
Let's make sure to write them down clearly..."

3011009020160,樹里,"んじゃあ、次な
──『カバンの中に入っているものは？』","Alright, the next question is: ""What do you have in
your bag right now?"""
3011009020170,智代子,これは見てみた方が早いよね,It'd probably be faster if I just showed you.
3011009020180,智代子,"……お財布と定期と、スマホと充電器でしょ？　イヤホンと
音楽プレーヤーとポーチもあって……あと勉強道具と──","Let's see... I have my wallet, railway pass, phone, and

purse, my school supplies, and..."

さすがです……",Fufu... As expected...
3011009020210,樹里,……まあ、普通そんな感じだよな,"Yeah, I guess that's generally the norm for most people."

3011009020250,智代子,"なんか、あんまり代わり映えしないけど
大丈夫かな……！？",Is it okay for our answers to be this plain!?
3011009020260,樹里,"いいんじゃねーの
アンケートの概要のとこにも、確か……","It should be fine, right? We're just following the
instructions for the questionnaire. "
3011009020270,樹里,"『今回は放課後クライマックスガールズ、
女子高生３人組のリアルな私生活を徹底解剖』ってあるし","It's just as it says: ""A closer look into the life of
Hokago Climax Girls' three high school idols."""

普通で！","It's only natural for a common questionnaire like this
to have fairly common answers! "

とも……","It also says... ""We're sure our readers have been
looking forward to this issue..."""

『最近注目しているスポットは？』","Alright, next question. ""What are some locations
that you have been wanting to check out?"""
3011009020340,樹里,うーん……,Hmmm...
3011009020350,樹里,"こういうのたまに聞かれるけど
毎回答えに困るんだよなー……","This question is pretty common too, but I never know
how to answer this..."
3011009020360,智代子,"私も……
行ってみたいケーキ屋さんとか……","Same. I guess there's this cake shop I've been
wanting to check out..."
3011009020370,智代子,"日本初上陸のチョコタルト専門店とかしか
思い浮かばなくて……","Also, the first chocolate tart shop in Japan opened
recently too. I can't think of the others off the top
of my head."
3011009020380,樹里,や、それで充分だろ……！,"No, I think that answer is fine!"
3011009020390,凛世,はい……,Yes...
3011009020400,凛世,"『銀河級にスゴい！』……

3011009020410,智代子,"えっ、ほんと！？　これで大丈夫かな！？
じゃあ書いちゃおう……！","You really think so!? You guys really think this will be
enough!? Then I'll write that down!"
3011009020420,樹里,"アタシは『特になし』で、いいか……
いや本当はよくないけど……","I guess I'll just write ""nothing in particular"" then...
God, that sounds boring..."

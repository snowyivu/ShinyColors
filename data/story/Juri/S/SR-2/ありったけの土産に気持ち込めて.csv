You guys are on vacation so take it easy!"""

旅行券の期限が、もうちょっと長かったら……",Uuu... If only this trip was longer...
3011005020140,樹里,"あぁ……それだったら、どーにかして５人で来ることも
できたかもしんねーのに……","Yeah... If that was the case, all five of us would
probably be able to come along."
3011005020150,凛世,"ですが……
快く……送り出してくださいました……","But then again... 
We were fortunate... to be given the chance to come
here..."
3011005020160,樹里,"そうだな……
…………","Well that's true... 
......"
3011005020170,果穂,…………,......
3011005020180,凛世,…………,......
3011005020190,果穂,"うーん……今も頑張ってるちょこ先輩と夏葉さんにも
温泉気分を味わってもらえればいいんですけど……","Hmmm. But with how hard Choco-senpai and
Natsuha-san are working, I really want to give them
a taste of the onsen somehow."
3011005020200,樹里,"──温泉気分……
そうか……！　それだよ！",A taste of the onsen... I see! That's it!
3011005020201,果穂＆凛世,……？,......?
3011005020210,樹里,──果穂、凛世！,Kaho! Rinze!
3011005020220,樹里,"チョコと夏葉にはありったけの
土産を買ってくぞ！！",Let's buy Choco and Natsuha some souvenirs!
3011005020230,智代子,"３人とも……こんなにたくさんのお土産、
ありがとうっ！","You guys... You bought all these souvenirs for us?
You shouldn't have!"
3011005020240,果穂,"はいっ！
一緒に食べて、温泉気分を味わいましょうっ","No worries! We can eat them together and enjoy a
taste of the onsen together!"
3011005020250,智代子,"果穂……！
その気持ち、すっごく嬉しいよ……！",Kaho! I can't express how happy I am for all this!
3011005020260,智代子,……でも、えっと……それにしても──,But still... Isn't this...
3011005020270,夏葉,"お饅頭にバームクーヘン、ラスク、お蕎麦にプリン
他にもたくさん……さすがに多すぎないかしら……？","Some baumkuchen cakes, rusk biscuits, buckwheat
custards, and many more... Don't you think that this
is a bit excessive?"
3011005020280,果穂,"そ、そうなんですけど……
それは……","Yeah, but don't you think that it's...
That it's..."
3011005020290,樹里,……あー、なんつーか……,Ummm... How do I put this...?
3011005020300,樹里,"仕方ねーのはわかってんだけど
どーしてもふたりに申し訳なくなっちまってさ……","I figured, but I couldn't stop myself at the moment.
I just really wanted to make it up to you two..."
3011005020310,夏葉,……そう……,I see...
3011005020320,夏葉,"仲間との旅行……
いいわよね、そういうのって……","A trip with friends, huh...
So that was what could have been..."
3011005020330,樹里,"な、夏葉……？
ほら、限定のプリンでも食って元気出せ──","N-Natsuha? H-here, you'll feel better if you try some
of the special custardsー"
3011005020340,夏葉,ふふっ……,Fufu...
3011005020350,夏葉,"騙されたわね樹里！
今の演技、どうだったかしら？","I got you good, Juri!
How did you like my acting just now?"
3011005020360,夏葉,"ドラマの出演に向けて、
演技レッスンにも力を入れてきたのよ！","While I was performing for the drama, the other cast
members taught me a few things to help improve my
acting skills!"
3011005020370,樹里,"なっ……
んだとぉ！？　心配して損した！","Wh-What the heck!?
I was genuinely worried just now!"
3011005020380,智代子,"まぁまぁ、おふざけはその辺にして
仲良く食べようよー","Now, now. Don't sweat the small stuff.
Let's just be good friends and enjoy these treats
together!"
3011005020390,智代子,"どれからいこうかなぁ……
全部美味しそう……",Which one should I eat first? They all look so good!
3011005020400,果穂,"ちょこ先輩ちょこ先輩っ、このおまんじゅう、
試食したら、とっても美味しかったです！","Choco-senpai, Choco-senpai!
You gotta try the manju first! It's so tasty!"
3011005020410,智代子,"ほんとっ！？
じゃあこれ、いただきまーすっ！","Really! In that case, that's what I'm going to dig into
first!"
3011005020420,凛世,どうぞ……,For you...
3011005020430,凛世,"粗茶ですが……
菓子に……合いましょう……","It's just simple tea... but it goes perfectly with
snacks..."
3011005020440,夏葉,ありがとう、凛世,"Thanks, Rinze."
3011005020450,夏葉,"──あら
このプリン、美味しいじゃない","Oh wow. This custard really is delicious. "
3011005020460,夏葉,"……心配なんてしなくていいのに
……ばかね",You really didn't have to worry about me... You idiot...
3011005020470,樹里,アタシは……バームクーヘンにするか,I guess I'll try out some of the baumkuchen.
3011005020480,樹里,ん……うまい,Mmm. That's good.
3011005020490,樹里,…………,......
3011005020500,樹里,（……なんか……）,(Now that I think about it...)
3011005020510,樹里,"（一件落着、っつーか……こーやって５人で
うまいもん食って……これこそ幸せ、っつーか……）","(This kind of answers that question from before...
With all five of us eating some delicious food...
So, this is peace huh...)"
3011005020520,樹里,（もう、心配するようなことは何もな──）,(There really isn't anything I have to worry about──)
3011005020530,樹里,"…………あ
アンケート……忘れてた……","...... 
Ah. I forgot to fill out the questionnaire...
"
3011005020540,樹里,…………,......
3011005020550,樹里,……なぁチョコ……,Hey Choco...
3011005020560,智代子,……っ、なぁに樹里ちゃん？,... What's up Juri-chan?
3011005020570,樹里,"幸せで楽しい時間ほど、別の関係ないことを
考えちまうのって、なんでなんだろうな……","Why is it that people always tend to think of
completely unrelated things during times of peace?"
3011005020580,智代子,"ん～……
あ、確かに……",Hmmm... That's a good question...
3011005020590,智代子,"ケーキバイキングとか、お肉の食べ放題とか、あんなに
『食べたい！』って思ってお店に入ったはずなのに……","It's kind of like when you're at an all-you-can-eat
cake or meat buffet, and you see something that
really makes you go ""wow, I have to eat that!"""
3011005020600,智代子,"途中で『もう食べられない！　別の物が食べたい！』
ってなっちゃったりするもんね……！","But at that point, you're already eaten so much that
you think ""Ugh, I can't eat another bite! But I really
want to keep eating!"""
3011005020610,樹里,"……いや、それは……
ちょっと違うんじゃねーかな……","No, well...
I'm pretty sure that's something else altogether..."
3011005020620,智代子,…………あれっ？,Huh?

練習時間とってますし、絶対次までに作ってくるので……！","I-I can fix that. I'll figure something out...!
I'll make some time for practice, and I'll be ready to
do the routine together next time...!"
0000000000000,舞踏講師,"────七草さんは今日は少し残れるんだっけ？
そしたら合わせはここまで。ちょっと集中練習しよう","Nanakusa-san, you can stay a little late today, yes?
In that case, we'll leave it at that for trying the
routine together. You can practice by yourself."
5007002040080,にちか,はい……！,Yes...!
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"────ありがとな、感謝祭のこと
ふたりがチャレンジしてくれてるの、嬉しいよ","────Thanks, for the huge help you've been with
FanFest. It makes me happy the way you both are
challenging yourselves. "

0000000000000,プロデューサー,"舞踊の先生も紹介してもらって……
何から何まで、頼りっきりだな","And you sought out that dance instructor too...
I've had you to rely on for so many of the details
of the performance."
5007002040100,美琴,"……レッスンの段取りを付けたのは私じゃない
ステージの打ち合わせもかなり綿密なものになるし","...I'm not the one who schedules all the lessons.
You're the one who handles all of the logistics, too."
5007002040110,美琴,頼りにしてるの,"You've been reliable yourself. "
0000000000000,マネージャー,"……美琴
あの……────","...Mikoto.
I need to talk to you...────"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"……それはもちろんだよ
ふたりが考えるのは、舞台の上のこと","...Well, that's just doing my job.
What happens onstage is up to the two of you. "
0000000000000,プロデューサー,舞台の下のことは、俺の役目だ,"But what happens behind the scenes?
That's where I come in."
0000000000000,マネージャー,"ファン感のこと、もう練習してくれてるでしょ？
……すごいアイディアだなーって、感心してるんだ","You've already started practicing for the fan
event, haven't you? ...I'm so impressed by the idea
that you and Luca had for it."
5007002040130,美琴,"ありがとう
もっと詰めていこうって話していたの","Thank you. We've been discussing how we need to
start having more practice so we can prepare
properly. "
0000000000000,マネージャー,"そっか……
………………その、ごめんね────","You have, huh...
...Um, I'm so sorry, but────"
0000000000000,マネージャー,ルカのスケジュールが……これ以上は取れないの,"I can't allow practice for it to take up any more
of Luca's schedule. "
5007002040140,美琴,……──────,...──────
0000000000000,お笑い,"あ、にちかー！　おっはよー
今日もよろしくねー","Oh, Nichika! Hey.
Let's make a great show today!"
5007002040150,にちか,"……っ
おはようございます。よろしくお願いしますー……！","...Uh. Hello to you too!
Let's knock it out of the park...!"
5007002040160,にちか,"……ていうか
その呼び方やめてもらえたら嬉しいですー！","...Also, I'd appreciate if you would stop calling me ""Nichika""!"
0000000000000,お笑い,"あっはは、やるかこのやろー！
にちかにちかにちかー！","Ahaha, you wanna go, brat?
Nichika, Nichika, Nichika!"
0000000000000,マネージャー,"ルカ、レギュラーもまた決まったでしょ……？　もちろん
ファン感は成功させたい。……でも大事なタイミングなの","Luca's been made a show regular again, yeah...?
Of course I want the fan event to be a huge
success too. But this is a critical time for her..."
5007002040170,美琴,そうだね,That's true.
0000000000000,お笑い,"今日さ、なんか仕込んじゃおうぜー
リハの後ちょっと時間あるっしょ？","Hey, you wanna get together and think up some
gags and stuff today? You should have some time
after rehearsal, right?"
5007002040180,にちか,"えっ
あー、リハの後ー……────","Eh!
Hmmm, after rehearsal...───"
0000000000000,にちか,"だ、大丈夫です。大丈夫です……！
練習時間とってますし、絶対次までに作ってくるので……！","I-I can fix that. I'll figure something out...!
I'll make some time for practice, and I'll be ready to
do the routine together next time...!"
5007002040200,にちか,"……うーん。時間厳しめなんですよね、正直ー
めっちゃめちゃ忙しいのでー！","...I don't think I can. To be honest, I have barely any
flexibility right now. I'm really, really busy!"
0000000000000,お笑い,え、何ー。そんなー？,"Huh, what's the deal?
You really that tied up?"
5007002040210,にちか,"ですですー
暇な芸人さんと一緒にされたくないですねー！","I sure am! I'm not a good-for-nothing comedian,
I don't have that much free time on my hands."
0000000000000,お笑い,……えー,...Heeey.
0000000000000,マネージャー,"……それから、今日会議があって
コンテンポラリーっていうのは、しばらくやめておこうって","...So, since we have that meeting later today.
I think then'll be a good time to tell Luca that we're
giving up on the contemporary dance idea for now."
5007002040220,美琴,……え……？,...Eh...?
5007002040230,にちか,"……じゃ、失礼しまーす
あ、控室勝手に覗かないでくださいねー","...Well, I've got to get going.
Oh, and please don't go peeping in on me in the
dressing room, okay?"
0000000000000,お笑い,……,...
5007002040240,にちか,"…………えっ
す、すみません、今のつっこんでもらっていいですかねー！","...Eh. F-forgive me, that wasn't serious!
Go ahead and hit me with one of your usual
snarky comebacks!"
0000000000000,お笑い,……いいんだけどさ,"...Look, it's not a huge deal, but."
0000000000000,お笑い,俺、あくまで共演者だからね？,"At the end of the day we're co-stars, yeah?"
0000000000000,マネージャー,"今は時期が早いかなって……
ふたりのこと、じっくり育てていきたいの","It feels like it might be a little too early for it...
I'd like to take my time in helping the two of you
develop as a unit. "
0000000000000,マネージャー,"いつも応援してくれてる人は喜んでくれると思う
私も、こういうことどんどんやれるようにしていきたいよ？","I think your existing fans would have been thrilled
by the contemporary dance, and I'd love to let you
try more things like that in the future?"
0000000000000,マネージャー,"でも、『そういうユニットなんだ』って……
イメージ固まると、敷居が高いと思うお客さんも出てくる","But if your image gets too associated with the
experimental... Some of the audience will start
thinking that you're a hard unit to get into. "
5007002040250,美琴,……そうだね,...That's true.
0000000000000,マネージャー,"……
美琴────",...Mikoto────
5007002040260,にちか,"す、すみません……
……失礼しました。私────","I'm really sorry...
...That was extremely rude of me. I────"
0000000000000,お笑い,忙しいんでしょー、はいはい,"Yeah yeah, you're busy."
0000000000000,お笑い,"……七草さんの兄貴とかじゃないから、俺
番組作ってるチームっつうか……そのへんよろしくー","...I'm not your big brother, Nanakusa-san.
You can't treat me like it. We're more like, a team
that creates a show together... Keep that in mind."
5007002040270,美琴,"うん
それじゃあ、別のセットリスト考えないとね","Mm.
In that case, we'll need to think of a different setlist."
0000000000000,マネージャー,"あのね、ごめん美琴
ほんとに────","Look Mikoto, I'm sorry.
I really am────"
5007002040280,美琴,"いい加減なものは見せられないし……
仕方ないと思うけど","If the performance can't be done properly...
Then it's a shame, but I think it's inevitable. "
5007002040290,美琴,"────こういうことやらせてもらえるの、
なかなかない機会だから","────It's rare to be given an opportunity to do something like this. "
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"……それは俺の言葉だ
曲なんかもどうしていくか、早々に詰めよう","...I should be the one saying that. Let's try and
figure out what we're doing for the music as soon
as possible. "
0000000000000,プロデューサー,ただ────,Though────
0000000000000,舞踏講師,"────ちょっと難しいかもしれませんね……
もちろん、格好だけはつくようにしますけど","────It's starting to look like this might not be
completely feasible... Sure, it's slowly coming
together, but."
5007002040300,にちか,"──────っ……
１、２…………","───Guh...
1, 2..."
0000000000000,舞踏講師,"緋田は時間があっても、
彼女はそうじゃないんでしょう？　それに彼女────","Even if Aketa has plenty of time to practice,
that's not the case for Nanakusa. Not to mention,
Nanakusa doesn't have────"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"────ええ
恐らく……力量的に、少し時間が足りないですよね","────Yeah. With her current capabilities taken
into consideration... I fear it's likely that there
won't be quite enough time."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,……いや────,"...Nevermind, it's nothing────"
0000000000000,スマホ画面,"『感謝祭のこと、少し相談しないか
収録の後、挨拶だけ回ってくるから、晩メシにしよう』","""I'd like to talk to you about FanFest. I was planning
to stop by the studio after you're done recording,
so why don't we discuss things over dinner?"""

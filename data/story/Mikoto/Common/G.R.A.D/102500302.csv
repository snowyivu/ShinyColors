0000000000000,美琴の母,"美琴が来るなら
調律、頼んでおけばよかったね","If I knew you were coming home,
I would have requested the piano to be tuned."
1025003020020,美琴,"……ううん
急だったから、仕方ないよ","...It's fine.
It was short notice anyway, so I don't mind."
0000000000000,美琴の母,そう？,Are you sure?
1025003020030,美琴,"……うん
ちょっと散歩してくるね","...Yeah.
I'm going to take a walk."
0000000000000,美琴の母,"うん、いってらっしゃい
気をつけて……何か羽織っていく？","Okay, have a good one.
Be careful... Do you need a coat?"
1025003020040,美琴,……ううん、大丈夫,"...No, I'm fine."

0000000000000,美琴の父,──おかえりなさい、美琴,"──Welcome home, Mikoto."
0000000000000,美琴の父,"ずいぶん久しぶりだね
前にコンサートを見に行った時以来かな","It's been a really long time.
I haven't seen you since the last time I went to see
you in a concert."
1025003020080,美琴,"……うん
そうだね","...Yeah.
It's been a while."
0000000000000,美琴の母,"具合は大丈夫なの？
美琴が戻ってくるなんてよっぽどなんでしょう","Are you feeling okay?
It's a big deal that you're back home."
1025003020090,美琴,"ううん
少し咳が出るだけ","I'm fine.
Just coughing a little bit."
0000000000000,美琴の母,"そうなの？
そういえば昔も少し咳を拗らせたことがあったね","Is that so?
Come to think of it, you had a bit of a cough in the
past too."
0000000000000,美琴の母,すごく小さい頃だけど,When you were very little.
1025003020100,美琴,……そうだった？,...Really?
0000000000000,美琴の母,"うん、寒暖差のせいだって
しばらくして良くなってからはちっとも出なかったけど","Yeah, they said it was because of the change in
temperature.
It stopped once you got better, though."
1025003020110,美琴,"…………
そうなんだ","............
I see."
0000000000000,美琴の父,"そういえば美琴は新しい家になってから
初めて来るんじゃないか？","Isn't this is the first time Mikoto has been here since
we remodeled the house?"
1025003020120,美琴,え……,Eh......
0000000000000,美琴の母,"そうよ、お家建て替えるって言った時も
戻ってこなかったから","Yeah, when we said we were going to remodel the
house, you said you weren't coming back."
0000000000000,美琴の母,"いくつか荷物も送ったでしょ？
美琴の部屋を片付けた時に捨てないでって言ってた物","We also sent you your stuff, remember?
The things you told us not to throw away when we
cleaned out your room."
1025003020130,美琴,"ああ……うん
そうだったかも","Oh... Yeah.
That happened."
0000000000000,美琴の母,"もう……
綺麗になったから楽しみにしてて","Well... It's all nice and pretty now, so you should check
it out."
1025003020140,美琴,…………,............
1025003020150,美琴,"……ピアノは？
捨てちゃった？","...What about the piano?
Did you throw it away?"
0000000000000,美琴の父,"いや、あるよ……だけどもうずっと使ってないからな
美琴、使いたかったか？","Nope, it's still there... but we haven't used it since
forever.
Mikoto, did you want to use it?"
1025003020160,美琴,…………どうだろう,......I'm not sure.
1025003020170,美琴,わかんないや,I don't know.
1025003020180,美琴,…………,............

1025003020230,美琴,"……うん
どうしたの？　プロデューサー","...Yes. 
What's up, Producer?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"『いや……調子、どうかなと思って
実家のほうでゆっくりできてるか？』","""It's nothing... I was just wondering how you're doing.
Are you relaxing at your parents' place?"""
1025003020240,美琴,……どうかな,...I'm not sure.
1025003020250,美琴,よくわかんないや,I don't really know.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,わかんないって……,So you don't know...
1025003020260,美琴,"『ここには何もなくて……
何もすることがなくて』","""There's nothing here...
There's nothing for me to do here."""
1025003020270,美琴,"『時間がゆっくり進んで
いつまでも終わらないみたいでなんだか怖いの』","""Time moves so slowly,
I'm kind of scared that it's never going to end."""
0000000000000,プロデューサー,……美琴……,......Mikoto......
1025003020280,美琴,"昨日できてたことも、
もしかしたらもうできないかもって","""I'm afraid that I'll no longer be able to do
what I could do just yesterday."""
1025003020290,美琴,"何もしていない時間がゆっくり過ぎていくのは、
すごく────……","Time passes so slowly when I'm not doing anything,
I feel so────......"

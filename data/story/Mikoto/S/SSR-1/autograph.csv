It seems that you were earlier than me, right?"
3025003020080,にちか,"えへへ
ちょっと、早く着きすぎちゃって","Ehehe, I did get here a bit early."
3025003020090,美琴,"…………
それで、何をしていたの？","............
So then, what were you doing?"
3025003020100,にちか,え……！,Ehh....!
3025003020110,美琴,"さっき、慌てていたみたいだから
……何か隠したでしょ？","You seem to be in a rush.
......You're hiding something, aren't you?"
3025003020120,美琴,窓の外に何かあるの？,Is there something outside the window?
3025003020130,にちか,"……
あはは……","......
Ahaha......"
3025003020140,にちか,隠したわけじゃ……ないんですけど,I didn't exactly... hide it....
3025003020150,美琴,──あ……,──Ah......
3025003020160,美琴,"窓の所
それ、サイン……？","On the window
There's an autograph......？"
3025003020170,にちか,"はい……
あっ、遊んでただけなので気にしないでください！","Yes......
Ah, I was just playing around, so there's no need to worry!"
3025003020180,美琴,"そう
なんだ、隠すことないのに","I see.
Then there's no need to hide it."
3025003020190,にちか,い、いえ……,N-no......
3025003020200,にちか,"……あーもうっ
まじまじ見ないでください～～！","......Oh, man!
Please don't look～～!"
3025003020210,美琴,…………,............
3025003020220,美琴,……私も隣、書いてもいい？,.....Can I add mine too?
3025003020230,にちか,え──……,Ehh──......
3025003020240,美琴,────うん、書けた,"────There, I signed it."
3025003020250,にちか,…………！,............!
3025003020260,美琴,"……ちょっと曲がっちゃったかも
もっと練習しないとね","......It's a little crooked.
Maybe I need to practice more."
3025003020270,にちか,"美琴さん……！
手、汚れちゃいます！","Mikoto-san......!
Your hands will get dirty!"
3025003020280,美琴,"え？
こんなの、後で洗えば大丈夫","Huh？
It's fine, I'll wash them later."
3025003020290,にちか,"で、でも……！
────私、紙とペン探してきますね！","B-but......!
────Okay, I'm looking for a pen and paper!"
3025003020300,にちか,"それか私のノートでよければ
すぐに出るんですけど……！","Or we can use my notebook, I was going to bring it out anyways!"
3025003020310,美琴,"ううん、いいの
ここで","Nah, no need. Here is just fine."
3025003020320,美琴,"まだ書けるところ、いっぱいあるから
練習し放題でしょ？","There's plenty of space left to write on. We can get all the practice we need, right?"
3025003020330,にちか,それは……！,That's.....!
3025003020340,にちか,"あーっ
でも美琴さんのサインが消えちゃうのはもったいないです！","Ah...
But it's such a waste to see Mikoto-san's signature disappear!"
3025003020350,美琴,"…………
そうかな？","............
You think so?"
3025003020360,美琴,……私は消えちゃった方がいいな,...I'd rather get rid of it.
3025003020370,美琴,"練習の跡とか、失敗した跡なんて
最初から無かったみたいに","No traces of practice or failure, as if they weren't even there to begin with."
3025003020380,にちか,……っ,......
3025003020390,美琴,"いざサイン書くって時に
完璧に書ければ──","When it's time to sign an autograph, it's done perfectly──"
3025003020400,美琴,完璧な結果だけが残れば、いいのに,I wish I had only perfect results.
3025003020410,にちか,…………────,............────
3025003020420,美琴,……だけど,"......However,"
3025003020430,美琴,"それって、結果が出せなければ
何も残らないってことだから","That does mean that if I'm unable to produce results, nothing will remain."
3025003020440,美琴,"それが良い事なのか
どうかは、わからないけど","Whether or not that's a good thing, I don't know."
3025003020450,美琴,……私はその方が、いいな,......I think I prefer it that way.
3025003020460,にちか,………………,..............
3025003020470,にちか,"……残れば……
ううん、残せばいいんですよね","...If you leave it there...
Yeah, you just have to leave it."
3025003020480,にちか,……結果,......That's the result.
3025003020490,美琴,そうだね,"Yeah, you're right."
3025003020500,美琴,"ちゃんと何かが残せるような
私になりたいって、思ってるの",I would like to become the kind of person to leave behind something lasting.
3025003020510,美琴,……ここでね,......Right here.
3025003020520,美琴,────うん、完璧,────Yep. Perfect.

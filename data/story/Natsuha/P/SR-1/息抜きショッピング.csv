なかなかショッピングに来れてなかったのよね","I've been busy going between work and the gym lately, that I haven't gone shopping for a while."

普通は仕事場と家の往復なんじゃ……）","(Hmm? It's late to say it now but, shouldn't that be ""going between work and home""?)"

0000000000000,プロデューサー,"おーい夏葉、
こういうのはどうなんだ？","Say, Natsuha,
what about this one?"
2013003020090,夏葉,"そうね

I think I'll pass."

全然悩まないんだな……","You don't seem to think
twice when coming to a decision."

自分に似合うものぐらい、見たらすぐにわかるわ","Of course.
I would realize what would look good on me on just one glance."
2013003020110,夏葉,"それより、時間は有限なんだから
早く次の店にいきましょう","Anyways, our time is limited
so let's go the next store."

重いようだったら俺が持つぞ？","I was sure that you'd ask me to help you with that.
Still, I can carry some of those for you if you find them heavy."
2013003020120,夏葉,"大丈夫よ、プロデューサー
この重みがちょうどいいの","It's alright, Producer.
This kind of weight is just fine."
2013003020130,夏葉,"あの素敵な服が、
今私の手元にあるって感じられるから――","With this, I can feel that that
wonderful dress is right by my fingertips."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（女の子らしいことも言うんだな……）,(Quite a feminine thing to say.)
2013003020140,夏葉,それに、荷物持ちもトレーニングになるでしょう？,"Besides, carrying these can be turned into a work-out."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,まぁ、そ、そうだな,"Y-Yeah, good point."
2013003020150,夏葉,"でも、私が持てなくなったら
プロデューサーにも持ってもらおうかしら","Still, if I can't carry them anymore,
I guess I'll take up your offer to help."
2013003020160,夏葉,そのほうがたくさん服、買えるしね？,"That way, we can buy more clothes, right?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"……あ、ああ！

Feel free to shop around as much as you want."

2013003020180,夏葉,"でも、帰ってもよかったのに
付き合ってくれたじゃない","Still, you kept me company
even though you could leave, right?"
2013003020190,夏葉,"プロデューサーがいたから、自分の判断だけじゃなく
客観的な意見も聞くことができたのよ",It's because that you were with me that I was able to get an unbiased opinion other than my own judgment.
2013003020200,夏葉,"たまには誰かとショッピングを楽しむのもいいものね
今度は果穂たちを誘ってみようかしら","It's nice to have fun shopping along with someone.
Maybe I should Kaho and the others next time."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,ああ、いいんじゃないか,"Yes, that's a good idea."
2013003020210,夏葉,"そうと決まれば計画を立てないといけないわね
うふふ、また新しい楽しみができたわ！","With that agreed on, we have to make plans for that.

誰かと一緒に、というのも新鮮で楽しかったわ","It's nice to go shopping on my own but, going shopping with someone else is fun and refreshing."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"役に立てたならよかった
今日買ってたもの、夏葉によく似合ってたぞ",I'm just happy I could help out. Everything you brought today really looked good on you.
2013003020280,夏葉,"と、当然よ
自分に何が似合うかなんてわかりきってるもの","O-Of course.
I know which ones would look good on me."
2013003020290,夏葉,でも……ありがとう、うれしいわ,"Still, thank you. I'm happy to hear that compliment from you."
2013003020300,夏葉,"急にフリーになったときはどうしようかと思ったけど、
プロデューサーのおかげでリフレッシュできたわ","I was worried what we're going to do because we suddenly have some free time in our hands but, thanks to you, I was able to get refreshed."

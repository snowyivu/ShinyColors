早く次の店にいきましょう","Anyways, our time is limited
so let's go the next store."

重いようだったら俺が持つぞ？","I was sure that you'd ask me to help you with that.

2013003020120,夏葉,"大丈夫よ、プロデューサー
この重みがちょうどいいの","It's alright, Producer.
This kind of weight is just fine."
2013003020130,夏葉,"あの素敵な服が、
今私の手元にあるって感じられるから──","With this, I can feel that that
wonderful dress is right by my fingertips."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（女の子らしいことも言うんだな……）,(Quite a feminine thing to say.)
2013003020140,夏葉,それに、荷物持ちもトレーニングになるでしょう？,"Besides, carrying these can be turned into a work-out."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,まぁ、そ、そうだな,"Y-Yeah, good point."
2013003020150,夏葉,"でも、私が持てなくなったら
プロデューサーにも持ってもらおうかしら","Still, if I can't carry them anymore,
I guess I'll take up your offer to help."
2013003020160,夏葉,そのほうがたくさん服、買えるしね？,"That way, we can buy more clothes, right?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"……あ、ああ！

a change of pace?"
2013003020180,夏葉,"でも、帰ってもよかったのに
付き合ってくれたじゃない","Still, you kept me company
even though you could leave, right?"
2013003020190,夏葉,"プロデューサーがいたから、自分の判断だけじゃなく
客観的な意見も聞くことができたのよ",It's because that you were with me that I was able to get an unbiased opinion other than my own judgment.
2013003020200,夏葉,"たまには誰かとショッピングを楽しむのもいいものね
今度は果穂たちを誘ってみようかしら","It's nice to have fun shopping along with someone.
Maybe I should Kaho and the others next time."

誰かと一緒に、というのも新鮮で楽しかったわ","It's nice to go shopping on my own but, going shopping with someone else is fun and refreshing."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"役に立てたならよかった
今日買ってたもの、夏葉によく似合ってたぞ",I'm just happy I could help out. Everything you brought today really looked good on you.
2013003020280,夏葉,"と、当然よ
自分に何が似合うかなんてわかりきってるもの","O-Of course.
I know which ones would look good on me."
2013003020290,夏葉,でも……ありがとう、うれしいわ,"Still, thank you. I'm happy to hear that compliment from you."

プロデューサーのおかげでリフレッシュできたわ","I was worried what we're going to do because we suddenly have some free time in our hands but, thanks to you, I was able to get refreshed."

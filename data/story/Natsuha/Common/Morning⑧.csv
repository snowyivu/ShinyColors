トレーニング、始めたらしいじゃない","Good morning, Producer.
It seems like training is already underway."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"ああ、そうなんだ
だけどなかなか成果が出なくてね","Ah yes, it is. Although, they can't seem to make
any progress."
1013001000810020,夏葉,"そうなのね
どうしてかしら……","Is that so?
I wonder why..."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,うーん……,Hrm...
select,,とにかく続けるよ,"At any rate,
we'll keep going."
select,,やり方がまずい？,"Maybe their
methods are poor?"
select,,そろそろ潮時かな,"Maybe it's time
for a change..."
1013001000810030,夏葉,ええ、努力していれば結果はついてくるものよ,"Yes, if they put in the effort, I'm sure results
will come."
1013001000810040,夏葉,"とにかくと言わず
とことん続けましょう！","Let's not be dismissive of what happened, but let's
also keep going until the very end!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（よし、楽しく話せたな）,"(Nice, that went really well.)"
1013001000810050,夏葉,"確かに……
もしかしたら何かやり方に問題があるのかもしれないわ","That could be it...
Perhaps there's an issue with how they're
approaching it."
1013001000810060,夏葉,少し、一緒に見直してみましょうか？,Let's go check things out to see if we can help.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（まぁ、普通に話せたかな）,"(Well, I guess that went okay.)"
1013001000810070,夏葉,"潮時……ねぇ
途中で諦めてしまうの？","A change... you say? You're saying
they should give up midway through?"
1013001000810080,夏葉,"今まで頑張ってきたんでしょう？
ここでやめたらダメよ！","Everyone's done their best to get here, right?
It would be wrong to stop now!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,（うっ……しまった。別のことを言えば良かったな……）,(Ah... I should've said something else instead...)

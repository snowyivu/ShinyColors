0000000000000,プロデューサー,──それじゃ、俺と霧子はこのまま打ち合わせに行くよ,"──Alright then. Kiriko and I will be going to get 
started on the arrangements for later. "
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"摩美々は衣装合わせだったよな
場所は大丈夫そうか？　地図、送ったと思うけど……","And Mamimi, you'll be going to get your costume 
fitted. Do you know where to go? I believe I sent you 
the map earlier..."
5002002030010,摩美々,…………,*sniffle*
5002002030020,霧子,ま……摩美々ちゃん……？,"M-Mamimi-chan...?
"
5002002030030,摩美々,……っ……,"...ah...
"
5002002030040,霧子,だ、大丈夫──,A-Are you alrig──
5002002030050,摩美々,っくしゅ──……！,"choo...!
"
5002002030060,摩美々,"……はぁい、大丈夫ですー
地図も届いてますー","...Yeah, I'm okay.
And I did get the message with the map."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,……風邪ひいたんじゃないか？,"...Mamimi, have you come down with something?"
5002002030070,摩美々,"んー、こほっ……喉がちょっとだけー
この間の倉庫が埃っぽかったせいかもしれませんー","Mmm, *cough*... It's just something minor with my 
throat. I think it's because the storage shed was so 
dusty earlier."
5002002030080,霧子,"お薬……あるかな……
待ってて……","I think... There might be medicine at the office...
I'll have it waiting for you..."
5002002030090,摩美々,"薬なら自分でも飲めるケドー
……くしゅっ……まぁ、仕事終わったら事務所に戻るんでー","I can get some medicine on my own.
...achoo... Though, I guess, I'll be going back to the 
office after the job is done anyway."
5002002030100,霧子,"うん……気を付けてね……
じゃあ、後で……","Yes... Take care...
I'll see you later on, then..."
5002002030110,咲耶,"このパニーニとブレンドを……
ええ、店内で","I'd like to order this panini and this blend of coffee...
Yes, I'll be eating in."
5002002030120,咲耶,"ありがとう……いい香りだ
素敵なお嬢さんに淹れてもらえたからかな","Many thanks... It smells wonderful. Perhaps, because 
it was poured for me by such a lovely lady. "
5002002030130,咲耶,"ただ時間を潰すだけのつもりが、
思いのほか素晴らしい休息となりそうだよ","I only came in to kill some time, but with you here, 
I feel this will become a refreshing and much-needed 
break. "
5002002030140,咲耶,"カウンター席からキミの仕事を見ていても良いかい？
その笑顔を眺めながらの味は、きっと格別だろうからね","Do you mind if I watch you work from the counter? 
If I drink this coffee while gazing upon your precious 
smile, I'm sure the taste will be unparalleled. "
5002002030150,結華,"──ひどいじゃないあなた、私とは遊びだったの？
この貸し、それなりに高くつくわよ？","I can't believe you, darling! Was what we had just a 
fling? I'm expecting some serious compensation for 
this infidelity! "
5002002030160,咲耶,やあ、結華じゃないか！,"Fancy seeing you here, Yuika!
"
5002002030170,結華,"お疲れー
──あ、店員さん、私はハムサンドとアイスティー店内で！","Heeey!
──Oh, and Miss, I'd like an iced tea and a ham 
sandwich for here, please!"
5002002030180,結華,"……でもさ、ほんと流れるように王子だよね
三峰ずっと後ろにいたのになかなか声かけられなかったよ","...Really though, when you go prince-mode it's 
something else. Mitsumine's been behind you this 
whole time but she couldn't get a word in edgewise."
5002002030190,咲耶,"そうかい？　このあと一緒に仕事なのだから、
すぐにも声をかけてくれて良かったのに","You were? Since we have a job together right after 
this, I wished you would've called out to me sooner. "
5002002030200,結華,"さくやんと会うのも久しぶりだし、
第二の王子でいくかいい感じのお姉さんでいくか迷ってさぁ","It's been so long since we've seen each other, 
y'know? So I was debating whether I should greet you 
like a fellow prince or as a charming big sister."
5002002030210,結華,"……ていうか、この間はごめんね
結局ミーティング参加できなくって……","In any case, I wanted to apologize for the other day.
I felt bad that I couldn't make it to the meeting. "
5002002030220,咲耶,"ああ……
まとめたノートはお役に立てたかな？","Mmm...
Hopefully, the meeting notes I wrote were of use?"
5002002030230,結華,"それはもう！
ほんと助かったよー、おかげでみんなの話についていける","They sure were! Thanks to you, I was able to keep up 
with what everyone had been discussing."
5002002030240,咲耶,"フフッ、それはよかった
……けれど、結華に会えることを私は楽しみにしているんだ","Hehe, I'm so glad! Although, I have been looking 
forward to finally getting to see you again."
5002002030250,咲耶,次こそは、顔を見せてくれることを願っているよ,"From next meeting onwards, I pray that I'll be blessed 
by your lovely face."
5002002030260,結華,"おっけー任せて！
次はさくやんを悲しませない！","Alrighty, you got it! I won't break Sakuyan's heart 
next time!"
5002002030270,咲耶,"ああ、遠くても言葉を伝える手段はあるけれど、
こうして眼差しを合わせる会話とは違うものだからさ","Mmm. While there's ways to stay in touch when we 
can't see each other, it's still no replacement for 
meeting face to face. "
5002002030280,結華,"……やっぱり、直接じゃないと違う？
さくやん、たとえば……寂しかったりする？","...It's just not the same, huh? Sakuyan, would you say 
you've been feeling a little... lonely, lately?"
5002002030290,咲耶,ん？　フフ、そんなことは……,"Huh? Hehe, how could I...
"
5002002030300,咲耶,"……いや……そうだね
少しだけ寂しく感じることもあるよ","...Well, I can't deny it completely.
I have felt a bit lonesome. "
5002002030310,咲耶,"けれど、こうしてたまに会えるだけで、
すぐさま元気になれるんだ","But even if it's infrequent, as soon as we're able to 
see each other like this, I feel better immediately."
5002002030320,咲耶,だから平気さ,"So really, I'm just fine."
5002002030330,結華,平気かぁ、さくやんはガードが固いなぁ,"Just fine, huh.
You sure don't like showing weakness, Sakuyan."
5002002030340,結華,"……でもさ？　完璧な王子様が物憂げにしてたら、
気になっちゃうのが乙女心ってやつでしょ？","...But you know? It's a maiden's job to be worried 
when her perfect prince is in a funk!"
5002002030350,結華,"三峰的にはそういう……平気じゃないところ、
ぶっちゃけてもらえたら嬉しいなー……みたいな？","So personally, Mitsumine would really appreciate it if 
you could... Open up to her some about what's been 
bothering you? ...Maybe?"
5002002030360,咲耶,ん……？,Hm...?
5002002030370,咲耶,"そう言われても……フフッ
今日の結華はいたずらっこだね、私の心を惑わせる","Even if you ask that, I... hehe. You're a real devil 
today, Yuika. It's like you're trying to lead my heart 
astray."
5002002030380,咲耶,"けれど、うーん……思いつかないな
今、この時間が幸せすぎて……","But still, hmmm... I can't really think of anything 
that's been weighing on me. In this moment, I just feel 
too content..."
5002002030390,結華,幸せー……？　ほんとにー？,"Content...? You sure about that...?
"
5002002030400,咲耶,ああ、この瞳が嘘を言っているように見えるかい？,"Without a doubt. Are these the eyes of a woman 
who's lying?"
5002002030410,結華,"──じゃあ、そんなさくやんには別の質問
最近のバラバラなアンティーカについてはどう思う？","Alright then, Sakuyan. I've got a different question 
for you. How do you feel about L'Antica doing so much 
solo work lately?"
5002002030420,咲耶,え……？,"Huh...?
"
5002002030430,結華,"この頃、５人で揃っての仕事ってあんまりないでしょ？
もちろん、目の前のことは頑張らなくちゃだけど──","We've had hardly any jobs as a unit, y'know? 
Of course, right now we're all working together to 
prepare for FanFest, but..."
5002002030440,咲耶,ああ……ん……,"Ah... Mm....
"
5002002030450,結華,そういうの、さくやん的にはどうなのかなって,"I'd been wondering if maybe, you had some feelings 
about that?"
5002002030460,咲耶,"……ああ、もちろん。みんなが認められて、
輝いて、愛されているということだろう？","...Well, of course I do. I'm overjoyed to see the four of 
you being recognized on your own, and receiving love 
and praise for your efforts."
5002002030470,咲耶,私にとってそれ以上のことはないよ,"That sums up my feelings on the matter. "
5002002030480,結華,……,Mm.
5002002030490,結華,…………あのさ。さくやん,"...I'm gonna be honest with you, Sakuyan.
"
5002002030500,咲耶,"あっ……結華、見てごらん
店の外、霧子とプロデューサーだ","Ah... Yuika, look over there!
Kiriko and Producer just walked by outside."
5002002030510,結華,"──え。……うわっ、待ち合わせの時間過ぎてるじゃん！
三峰たちのこと探してるよね！？","Eh? ...Oh no, it's already past when we were supposed 
to meet up! They must've come searching for us!"
5002002030520,咲耶,"……喫茶店で過ごす時間は魔性だね
先に声をかけてくるよ。最後の一口を飲み干したらおいで","...Time flies when you're in a coffee shop. I'll go wave 
them down. You can head over once you've finished up 
your drink."
5002002030530,結華,"あ、うん、ありがとさくやん
でも──","Oh, sure! Thanks, Sakuyan.
But, still──"
5002002030540,結華,……,"*sigh*
"
5002002030550,結華,──────……,──────...
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"……ふー……
遅くまでお疲れ様、みんな……あれ──……？","...Whew. Thanks for staying so late, everyone. 
Er, wait, where's...?"
5002002030560,咲耶,ああ、結華と霧子なら薬局に向かったよ,"Oh, if you're looking for Yuika and Kiriko, they made a 
run to the drug store."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"お……そうだったのか
気付かなかったな……","Oh... Did they?
I didn't notice at all..."
5002002030570,咲耶,おや？　ふたりはアナタにも声をかけていたけれど……,"Oh? They did call out to you when they left...
"
5002002030580,咲耶,……今日はだいぶお疲れのようだね,"...Today must have tired you out.
"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"ああいや、すまんすまん
まだまだ疲れちゃいられないのにな","Ahhh, no, my apologies. 
There's no time to be sleepy right now."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"もうすぐ長期ロケもあるし……！
あ、ロケの進行表、あとで送っておくな","Not with the multi-day shoot coming up! Oh, I'll make 
sure to send over the detailed itinerary for that in a 
bit."
5002002030590,咲耶,……ああ、楽しみにしているよ,...Ah yes. I'm quite excited.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"久しぶりに全員揃っての現場だな！
やっとアンティーカらしい仕事だぞ","It's been ages since the five of you have been 
together for something! Finally, a job that's fitting 
for L'Antica."
5002002030600,咲耶,"アンティーカらしい……そうだね
──────でも……","A job fit for L'Antica... Certainly so.
───Although..."
5002002030610,咲耶,"アンティーカとしての活動がなくても、
みんなは困らないんじゃないかな？","I do wonder, if we stopped doing work as L'Antica, 
would it make much of a difference for the others?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,……ん？　どうして,...Huh? What makes you say that?
5002002030620,咲耶,"みんなそれぞれ認められていて、
個人の仕事でも充分活躍してるじゃないか","They're all renowned as individual idols, and they 
could easily make it just doing solo work."
5002002030630,咲耶,"恋鐘も、摩美々も、結華も、霧子も……
アンティーカがなくても輝いている……","Kogane, Mamimi, Yuika, Kiriko... I don't believe that any 
of them need L'Antica to be able to shine."
5002002030640,咲耶,……彼女たちが輝けるのなら,"...In fact, in order for them to shine even brighter──
"
5002002030650,咲耶,きっと、それは、『ここ』じゃなくたって──,"L'Antica may no longer be the place they need to be.
"
5002002030660,咲耶,"２８３プロでは、必ずしもユニットに所属しなくては
ならないってわけじゃないんだろう？","Being part of a unit isn't necessarily a requirement 
here at 283Pro, is it?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,それは……,"That's true...
"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"……よかったら、
奥でゆっくり話を聞かせてくれないか","...If you're up for it, why don't we settle down inside 
and discuss this a little more."
5002002030670,咲耶,"いや、そんな大したことじゃないんだ
たわむれに聞いてみただけさ","Oh, no, this isn't anything that serious.
I was just thinking aloud. Joking, really."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"まあまあ、近頃はくつろぐ時間も無かったし
久しぶりに咲耶のコーヒーが飲みたいな","Hey now, neither of have had much time to relax 
recently. I'd like to drink some of your specially 
brewed coffee again, Sakuya."
5002002030680,咲耶,"おや、嬉しいことを言ってくれるね
それなら喜んでご用意させていただくとしよう","Oho, you do know how to win me over.
I'll happily make you some, and then we can chat."
5002002030690,咲耶,フフッ、でも本当に……なんでもないんだ,"Hehe. Although, it's really... nothing at all.
"
5002002030700,？？？,────────,*sniffle*
5002002030710,？？？,……っ……,"...ah...
"
5002002030720,？？？,……くしゅっ……,"...choo...
"
5002002030730,霧子,ただいま……,We're back...
5002002030740,結華,"うわ、まみみん！？
どしたの、そんなとこ隠れて！","Eek, Mamimin!?
What were you doing hiding in there!?"
5002002030750,摩美々,……隠れてるわけじゃ、なかったんだケドー,"...I mean, I wasn't really hiding.
"
5002002030760,霧子,な、何か……あったの……！,"D-did something... happen...?
"
5002002030770,摩美々,んー…………,"Mmm...
"
5002002030780,摩美々,"別にー……
……くしゅっ","Not exactly...
...ahchoo..."

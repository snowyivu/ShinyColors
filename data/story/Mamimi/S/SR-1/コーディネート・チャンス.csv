3005003010010,結華,まみみん！　次の仕事、二人だねぇ,"Mamimin! Our next job is just us two, huh?"
3005003010020,摩美々,"そーみたいだねー
まぁ、よろしくー","Looks like it.
Well, let's do our beeest."
3005003010030,結華,"よろしくー
ちなみに番組のこと、何か聞いてる？","Likewise! By the way...
You heard what we'll be doing in the show, right?"
3005003010040,摩美々,"んー？　何かあったっけー
ってなんか三峰うれしそー？","Hmm? What about it?
You seem really happy about it, Mitsumine."
3005003010050,結華,"あはー、やっぱわかっちゃう？
だってその仕事、私服で出てって言われたからさ！","Yup! Haven't you heard?
We'll be able to wear our own clothes at the job!"
3005003010060,結華,人気のファッション番組だし、今から楽しみで！,"It's a popular fashion show, so I'm pretty psyched!"
3005003010070,摩美々,"あー、そーいえばぁ……
新鮮だとは思うケド……それ以上にめんどーかもー","Uh, come to think of it... I was thinking of going in a
flashy outfit for the show... But it sounds like a pain."
3005003010080,結華,えーっ、なんで？　どこが！？,"Ehhh, why? What part bothers you?"
3005003010090,摩美々,"私服ってところー
新鮮だけどめんどーかなぁ","The part where we wear our own clothes.
Dressing up all flashy is too much of a pain, right?"
3005003010100,結華,"そんなこと言わずにさぁ
三峰、まみみんの服、攻めてて好きなんだよ","How can you say that?
Mitsumine really likes your fashion sense!"
3005003010110,結華,"一緒に楽しく私服で出よー？
まみみんのかっこいいとっておき、三峰に見せてー！","I want us to have fun together in style, you know?
You got something cool going on, and Mitsumine
wants you to show it off!"
3005003010120,摩美々,"そう言われてもー、
服とかたくさんあるから選ぶのも大変なんだよー？","Even if you say that, I have too many clothes, and
having to pick an outfit seems like a draaag."
3005003010130,摩美々,"それに、衣装合わせのために
いっぱい持って来なきゃいけないのはもっとめんどー","Also in order to pick the best one, I'd have to bring
all of those clothes here, which is even mooore of
a drag."
3005003010140,結華,"あー……確かに、服持って事務所に
集合しなきゃなのは、ねぇ……","Huh, you're right about that...
We'd have to carry all of our clothes to the office..."
3005003010150,摩美々,"そうだよー？
荷物増えるだけだからねー","Riiight?
We'll just be overrun with luggage."
3005003010160,結華,"……いや、でも待って！
これはむしろチャンスなんじゃないだろうか！","...No, wait a sec!
This could actually be a great opportunity!"
3005003010170,摩美々,"チャンスー？
どーゆーことー？","An opportunity?
What do you meeean?"
3005003010180,結華,"三峰さ、まみみんのこと、
一度コーディネートしてみたいと思ってたんだよね","An opportunity for this Mitsumine to be your
personal coordinator for the day, Mamimin!"
3005003010190,摩美々,"私をー？
三峰、そんなこと考えてたんだねー","For meee? That's something only you can come up
with, Mitsumine."
3005003010200,結華,"そう！　だから、たとえ荷物が重くても、
着せ替えして遊ぶためだと思えば苦じゃないはず……！","Yep! So even if your luggage was heavy, it wouldn't be
too much trouble if you think that it's for changing
clothes and dressing up!"
3005003010210,結華,"三峰はこのチャンスをゲットしたい！
どうかな、まみみん！？","This is the chance Mitsumine wants to take!
What do you think, Mamimin?"
3005003010220,摩美々,三峰が私をコーディネートかぁ……,Mitsumine as my coordinator...
3005003010230,摩美々,まぁ……それは面白そうかもー,Well... I guess that kinda sounds like fun.
3005003010240,結華,おっ、好感触！　いいよいいよまみみん！,"Oh! An agreement! Good to hear, Mamimin!"
3005003010250,摩美々,"ちょっと興味出たかもー
……私も私でー……","There's something on my mind though...
It's just that I..."
3005003010260,結華,ん？　あれどしたの？　やっぱやめるとかそういう？！,"Hmm? What is it?
Don't tell me you want to back out already?!"
3005003010270,摩美々,"ふふー
チャンスっていえば、私もそうかもーって思ったんだぁ","Fufu...
I also think it's a good opportunity."
3005003010280,摩美々,……実は前から三峰の服、気になってたんだよねー,"I've been really interested in your clothes for a while
now, Mitsumine."
3005003010290,摩美々,"服のセンスとかぁ、合わせとかぁ
けっこー見てたりするんだよー？","Your fashion sense and your outfits are something
I'd like to try out for myself."
3005003010300,結華,"おおっ、ほんとに？
三峰のファッションに興味あったりする？","Woah! Really?
You're really interested in Mitsumine's style?"
3005003010310,摩美々,そうかもー,Yeah.
3005003010320,摩美々,"三峰って個性的な格好が多いからぁ、
けっこー私と服のセンス近いと思っててー","You've perfected many unique outfits.
Your fashion sense isn't that far off from mine
either."
3005003010330,摩美々,"だから三峰がどーゆー服持ってくるのか、
ちょっと気にはなるかなぁ","That's why I'm curious on what you'll be bringing,
Mitsumine."
3005003010340,結華,"なるほど、だったらなおさらラッキーなんじゃない？
まみみん、三峰の服見放題だよ","I see. Aren't you a lucky one?
I'll even let you look around as much as you want!"
3005003010350,結華,"……あ、そうだ。ここまできたらさぁ、
まみみんも三峰の服、コーディネートしてよ！","...Ah, okay. Since we're going all the way here...
...You can coordinate for Mitsumine too!"
3005003010360,摩美々,私も三峰の服、選んでいいってことー？,You're okay with me picking yooour clothes?
3005003010370,結華,"そうそう！
まみみんは三峰の！　三峰はまみみんの！","You bet!
Mamimin will do Mitsumine's!
And Mitsumine will do Mamimin's!"
3005003010380,結華,"お互いのセンスで、お互いに着せたい服を選んだら
面白そうじゃない？","Wouldn't it be interesting to see how we'll look
after we dress each other up?"
3005003010390,結華,"手持ちの服で、自分じゃ絶対思いつかないコーデが
見れたりするかもしれないし！","With the clothes we're bringing over, we might be
able to create new outfits for each other that we
wouldn't ever have thought of on our own!"
3005003010400,摩美々,"確かにおもしろそーだねー、
三峰のことコーディネートしてみたかったし、いいよー","It really doooes sound like fun if you put that way.
I've been wanting to coordinate an outfit for you too.
Let's do it."
3005003010410,摩美々,そしたら、私もちゃんと服持ってこなきゃだなぁ……,"And I guess, this means I really have to think about
what to choose..."
3005003010420,摩美々,"三峰のおかげで、
ちょっとやる気でたかもー","Thanks to you, Mitsumine...
...I might even feel a bit motivated."
3005003010430,摩美々,"私服持ってくるのはやっぱりめんどーだけどー
楽しみができたから頑張ろーかなぁ","Lugging all of my clothes is still a drag, but at least
you got me looking forward to something.
Maybe I really should put in more work."
3005003010440,結華,やーった！　まみみん物分かりがいい！,Woohoo! Mamimin's so understanding!
3005003010450,摩美々,三峰の服、楽しみにしてるからぁ,"Mitsumine, I'm looking to your clothes most of all."
3005003010460,結華,三峰もだよ、当日よろしくね,Mitsumine too! I can't wait!
3005003010470,摩美々,"ふふー
衣装合わせ、けっこー楽しみかもー","Fufu, I'm actually kinda looking forward to
picking out our outfits together."

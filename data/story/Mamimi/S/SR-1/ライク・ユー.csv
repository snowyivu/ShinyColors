収録無事終わって良かったねぇ","Good work out there, Mamimin!
I'm glad the recording went well."
3005003030020,摩美々,三峰もお疲れー,"Same to you, Mitsumine."
3005003030030,結華,"やっぱり私服は楽でいいよ
こういうお仕事、またあるといいな","It was smooth sailing wearing our own clothes.
I hope we get another job like this."
3005003030040,摩美々,"そーかもー
私も悪くなかったと思うー","I hope sooo...
I didn't think it was a bad time."
3005003030050,摩美々,"あとはねー、
私はぁ、衣装合わせが楽しかったなぁ","Annnd of course...
I had fun trying out new outfits with you."
3005003030060,結華,この前の時も、また服見せてって言ってたもんね,"You asked me if I can show you more of my clothes
the other day, didn't you?"
3005003030070,摩美々,"言ったねー
けっこー好きな感じの服多かったし、また見たいからぁ","I suuure did. I liked a lot of what I saw,
so I want to see them again."
3005003030080,結華,"三峰もまた、まみみんの服みたいよ～
次、まみみんと会えるのはー……","Mitsumine wants to see Mamimin's clothes again too～
Let's see... The next time we can meet up is..."
3005003030090,結華,"あっ、この日とか？　レッスンの時間被ってるし
なんか持ってきちゃう？","Ah. How about on the day our lessons overlap?
I wonder what I should bring this time..."
3005003030100,摩美々,"じゃあ、その日にしよー
私も服持ってくるからぁ","Let's do it on that day, theeen.
I'll bring in more of my clothes too."
3005003030110,結華,"やっりぃ！
まみみんの服、楽しみにしてるからね！","Awesome!
I'm looking forward to them!"
3005003030120,摩美々,"私も三峰の持ってくる服に期待しとこー
ふふー","I can't wait to see what sort of clothes you'll be
bringing next time, Mitsumine. Fufu..."
3005003030130,摩美々,"（私もどれを持っていくか考えよー
家にある服で三峰に似合いそうなのはぁ……）","(Now to figure out what to bring. I wonder what I
have back home that would look good on Mitsumine...)"
3005003030140,摩美々,"（あ、そーいえばあの服まだ見せてなかったっけー？
三峰好きそーだしあれ持っていこうかなぁ……）","(Oh right. I didn't show her that one outfit yet, did I?
It seems like something Mitsumine would like,
so I should bring that one over...)"
3005003030150,摩美々,"おはよーございまぁす
あー、三峰もう来てたんだぁ？","Gooood moooorning...
Ahhh... You're alreaady here, Mitsumine?"
3005003030160,結華,"おはよーまみみん！　そりゃあ楽しみだったからねぇ
それより見て見てこれっ！","Goood morning, Mamimin! That's because I was
excited! Check these out!"
3005003030170,摩美々,……あれー？　この服見たことないやつだよねー？,What the... Aren't these waaay different from before?
3005003030180,結華,"さっすがお目が高い！
今日のはね、こないだ持ってきた服とは全部違うやつだよ","Good eyes you have there!
Indeed, today's clothes are different!"
3005003030190,結華,"ほら、これなんてどう？
三峰としてはまみみんにぜひ着てほしいんだけど","Here, what do you think of this?
Mitsumine would love for Mamimin to try this on."
3005003030200,摩美々,"どれー？
……これは、確かにいいかもねー、かわいすぎなくてー","Which one?
...Oh this one's good. It's not too cute either."
3005003030210,結華,"だよねだよね！
あとは～……これとか、あとそれも……","Exactly! Next up is this one～
And this one too! And maybe this one after..."
3005003030220,摩美々,"けっこーたくさん見たかもー
三峰たくさん持ってきてたからねー","Mitsumine, you brought in so many clothes
for me to look at..."
3005003030230,結華,"三峰としてはこれでもまだ足りないくらいなんだよ？
でもまぁそろそろ、まみみんの服も見たいかなぁ","Having all of these isn't enough for me, y'know?
But I think it's time for me to see what clothes you
brought in, Mamimin."
3005003030240,摩美々,"いいよー好きに見てー
私も三峰にまだ見せてないの持ってきたからぁ","Go aheaaad. Look all you want.
I got stuff that I haven't shown you yet too."
3005003030250,結華,ありがと！　ふっふ～ん♪,Thanks! Huhu～♪
3005003030260,摩美々,"あ、そーだ、
あれ先に渡しとこーかなぁ……","Oh right, I should probably hand this over..."
3005003030270,摩美々,"三峰、ちょっと待ってー
先に渡したいのあるから服見るのストップー","Hold on, Mitsumine... Stop looking around at my
clothes so I can give this to you."
3005003030280,結華,"ん？　いいけど……
渡したいもの？","Hm? Sure then...
What did you want me to try on?"
3005003030290,摩美々,"えっとー
これなんだけどー……三峰にあげよーと思ってー","Well...
I was thinking of actually giving this to you."
3005003030300,摩美々,"合わせるの難しいケド
三峰ならだいじょーぶだと思うー","It's a hard piece to fit into an outfit, but I think you
can figure out something to wear it with."
3005003030310,結華,"ありがとう。……でもまたなんで三峰に？
や、くれるんならありがたくもらうんだけども","Oh thanks, but... why give it to Mitsumine?
Well, I'm glad you're giving it to me but..."
3005003030320,結華,"わぉ、まみみんこんな服も持ってたんだ
これはこれは、なかなか合わせるのが難しそうな……","Oh wow, even Mamimin has something like this!
This one really looks like a challenge to match..."
3005003030330,摩美々,"買ったのはいいんだケドー、
それっきり着てなくてー","I was happy when buying it,
but I never wore it since."
3005003030340,摩美々,"でも、この服三峰っぽいし、
似合いそうだなぁーって思ったんだよねー","But it pretty much has ""Mitsumine"" written
all over it. So I think it'll look great on you."
3005003030350,結華,三峰っぽいって、どの辺が？,"What about me makes it ""Mitsumine?"""
3005003030360,摩美々,んー、どの辺って言われてもー……,"Hmm, what about you, huh?"
3005003030370,摩美々,三峰っぽいは、三峰っぽいってことー,"What makes it ""Mitsumine"" is the
""Mitsumine""-ness it has."
3005003030380,結華,"えー？
気になるじゃん、教えて教えて？","Ehhh? Oh don't leave me hanging like that!
Can't you tell me?"
3005003030390,摩美々,"そんなこと言われてもー、
私もうまく言えないしー","Even if you beg like thaaat,
I can't put it well enough in words."
3005003030400,結華,"そうなの？
うーん、着てみたら何かわかりそう？","You sure?
Welp, guess I'll find out when I put it on, then."
3005003030410,摩美々,"そーだねー
試しに着てみなよー","That's riiight, juuust try it on."
3005003030420,結華,"おっけー。そしたら例えばこれとこれを……
このパンツと合わせて……小物もつけて……","Okay... Then I can pair it with this one...
Same with these pants here...
This accessory should work with it too..."
3005003030430,結華,"こんな感じで！
まみみん的にはどう？","Eureka! I got it!
How does it look, Mamimin?"
3005003030440,摩美々,"（自己主張強いケド、周りと合わせるのが上手な三峰って
感じのコーディネートだなぁ）","(Mitsumine may be bold and assertive, but she's also
skilled at fitting in wherever she's at. The outfit she
put together is just like her personality.)"
3005003030450,摩美々,……そっかぁー,...I seee.
3005003030460,結華,え。どしたの、何に納得したのさまみみん？,"Eh? What's wrong? Does it look good, Mamimin?"
3005003030470,摩美々,やっぱり三峰っぽいなぁ、って思ってー,"Just as I thought. It's very ""Mitsumine."""
3005003030480,結華,"またそれー？
そりゃあ三峰が考えてるんだから三峰っぽいだろうけど","We're doing this again? Maybe it's ""Mitsumine""
because this outfit is Mitsumine's idea."
3005003030490,結華,そういう感じで言ってるんじゃないよね？,Was that what you're trying to say?
3005003030500,摩美々,"んー……、
やっぱりナイショー","Heh...
I'm not telling."
3005003030510,結華,ええー、教えてよ～！,Ehhhh?! Tell meee～!
3005003030520,摩美々,ふふー、だーめー,"Fufu, nooot happening."

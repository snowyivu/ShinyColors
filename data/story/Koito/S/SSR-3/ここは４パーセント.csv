T-This is amazing...!"
3022007010060,小糸,わたしたちの曲だ……！,They're playing our song...!
3022007010070,円香,まあ,"Well,"
3022007010080,円香,冠番組だからね,that'll be because the show's about us.
3022007010090,透,"ふふっ
んー","Fufu.
Hmー"
3022007010100,雛菜,"でもそれって
すごいことなんじゃない～？","But watching it like this, 
isn't this like the coolest thing～?!"
3022007010110,小糸,"……う、うん！
そうだよね……！","...Y-Yeah!
It really is cool...!"
3022007010120,透,えーと……,Um...
3022007010130,透,"あ
すいません","Ah, 
sorry."
3022007010140,透,"字、小さくて
カンペの","The writing was too small. 
On the cue card."
3022007010150,透,"『浅倉
まずは写経を体験させていただきます』","“Asakura -
Firstly, we'll begin by copying the sutra by hand.”"
3022007010160,円香,それ、『浅倉』は読まなくていいやつ,"You don't have to read out the “Asakura” part, y'know."
3022007010170,透,"あー……
ふふっ","Ahー...
Fufu."
3022007010180,雛菜,"なんか、これ
こんなにウケてたっけ～？","I don't get it, 
did we really get this many laughs at the time～?"
3022007010190,円香,"後から笑い声
乗せてるんでしょ","They edit in the laughter 
after the recording is done."
3022007010200,雛菜,"あ～……
そっか～！","Ohhh～
I get it now～!"
3022007010210,小糸,"で、でも
こうやって大きい笑い声が聞こえると",I-Isn't that because everything seems so much funnier
3022007010220,小糸,すごく面白く感じない……？,when you hear such a big laugh from the audience like this...?
3022007010230,透,あー,Ah
3022007010240,円香,ていうか、それが狙いなんじゃない？,"Isn't that what they're after in these kinds of shows?
"
3022007010250,円香,知らないけど,I can't say for sure though.
3022007010260,雛菜,"声大きくするくらいなら
ヤラセじゃないもんね～","If it's loud laughter then 
it seems less fake, right～?"
3022007010270,雛菜,いった～～～～～～い！,Ouuuuch～!
3022007010280,小糸,…………！,......!
3022007010290,雛菜,"あは～……
雛菜寝ちゃってた～？","Aha～...
Did Hinana fall asleep～?"
3022007010300,円香,……完全に,...Out like a light.
3022007010310,雛菜,そっか～……,"Oh, well～..."
3022007010320,雛菜,"ん～
でも今のですっごい目、覚めたかも～！","Ahhh～
But thanks to that I'm suuuper awake now～!"
3022007010330,透,"あー
ふふっ","Ahー
Fufu."
3022007010340,透,"ここ、覚めた
めっちゃ","This part woke me
right up."
3022007010350,雛菜,"へ～
透先輩も寝てたのに、雛菜だけ叩かれたの～！？","No fair～
If Toru-senpai was sleeping too, why did only Hinana get hit～?!"
3022007010360,小糸,"と、透ちゃんは寝てなかったよ……！
ぎ、ギリギリだけど","T-Toru-chan wasn't sleeping though...!
W-Well...she almost was..."
3022007010370,透,起こしてもらったから,"Thanks to a certain someone waking me up,"
3022007010380,透,ね,right?
3022007010390,雛菜,"へ～
雛菜は起こしてもらってない～！","Ehhh～
But Hinana wasn't woken up at all～!"
3022007010400,円香,"……雛菜、夜も爆睡してたのに
なんでここでも寝てたの","Even though you slept so much at night... 
how did you end up to sleeping here too?"
3022007010410,雛菜,"だって
すっごい早起きだったでしょ～？","But we were up sooo early～! 
I can't help it."
3022007010420,雛菜,雛菜、いつもはもっとたくさん寝るもん～,Hinana usually sleeps sooo much longer than this～
3022007010430,円香,あっそ,Ah... right.
3022007010440,雛菜,"ん～
疲れた～……","Ahhh～
I'm beat～..."
3022007010450,透,んー……,Ahhhー...
3022007010460,雛菜,"ね、そういえば
誰がいちばん早かった～？","Hey, now that I mention it, 
who was the first to get up～?"
3022007010470,雛菜,"雛菜
大変すぎてわかんなかったけど～……","It was too hard for
Hinana to tell～"
3022007010480,円香,じゃ、小糸ってことで,That'd be Koito.
3022007010490,小糸,え？,Huh?
3022007010500,透,"あー
ふふっ","Ahー
Fufu."
3022007010510,透,そうかも,You might be right.
3022007010520,雛菜,"なんだ～
雛菜じゃなかったのか～","So it wasn't Hinana then?～
Oh well～"
3022007010530,透,"あー……
まだやってない、これ","Ohー
I haven't given you this yet, Koito-chan."
3022007010540,透,小糸ちゃんに飲み物,"Here, your drink."
3022007010550,小糸,"え……！
だからそれはいいって……！","Eh...! 
It's really fine, I don't need anything...!"
3022007010560,雛菜,"へ～
だめだよ～！","Ehhh～?
Stop right there～!"
3022007010570,雛菜,"小糸ちゃんがいいよって言ったら
もし次に雛菜が勝った時に、賞品貰いにくいでしょ～？","If Koito-chan doesn't want some, then when I go buy
them next time it'll be even harder for me to win the
special prize, y'know～?"
3022007010580,小糸,"え……
あ、う、うん……？","Uh...
Um...y-yeah...?"
3022007010590,円香,……ま、そういうことで,"...Well, that's that then."
3022007010600,透,うん,Mhm.
3022007010610,透,貯めとく。小銭,We'll save it then. For later.
3022007010620,雛菜,"あ、エンディングも
曲かかった～","Ah! 
They played the song again during the ending～!"
3022007010630,透,"え、
もう終わり？","Wait, 
it's over already?"
3022007010640,小糸,"な、なんか……
すっごい早かったね……","W-Wow... 
it went by so fast..."
3022007010650,円香,何？　面白くなかった？,What's up? Did you not enjoy it?
3022007010660,小糸,"お、面白かった……！
と、思うけど……","I-I did...
I thought it was good...!"
3022007010670,小糸,"それって、わたしたちだけなのかな……って
思っちゃって……","I'm just wondering if maybe...it's only us that think so... 
or something like that..."
3022007010680,透,まぁ、４％,We should give it our own ratings.
3022007010690,透,"視聴率
うちらで","Let's say 4%, 
from all of us here."

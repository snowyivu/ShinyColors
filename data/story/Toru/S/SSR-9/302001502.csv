3020015020030,小糸,わ、わたしも……！,M-Me too...!
3020015020040,透,"うう……
いてて","Ugh...
It hurts."
3020015020050,透,食べた種は,"If you eat the seed,"
3020015020060,透,頭に行くらしい,"it ends up on top of your head. 
Apparently."
3020015020070,透,それで────,Then────
3020015020080,小糸,あ、透ちゃんから……！,"Ah, it's Toru-chan...!"
3020015020090,小糸,まだ頭痛いって……,"Her head still hurts, she says..."
3020015020100,雛菜,"昨日からずっとだね
風邪かな～？","It's been like that since yesterday.
I wonder if it's a cold～?"
3020015020110,円香,さあ,Who knows.
3020015020120,雛菜,"お見舞い行くなら
なんか買ってく～？","If we're visiting her,
how about we get her something～?"
3020015020121,円香＆小糸,ん,Yeah.
3020015020130,透,"それで
咲かせるらしい、花を","Then, it sprouts.
Into flowers."
3020015020140,透,バーン,Baaang.
3020015020150,雛菜,"えっと～
みかんゼリーと、もものゼリーと……","Let's see～
An orange fruit jelly, peach jelly, and..."
3020015020160,雛菜,あ、このプリンおいしそう～～～！,"Ah, this pudding looks delicious～!"
3020015020170,小糸,"ひ、雛菜ちゃん……！
透ちゃんのお見舞いの品だからね……！","H-Hinana-chan...!
Remember that we're buying stuff for Toru-chan,
okay...!"
3020015020180,雛菜,"うん～
わかってるよ～","Yep～
I know～"
3020015020190,円香,"あと、果物とか
そのまま食べられるやつ","Also, maybe we can get stuff like fruits.
Things you can eat as they are."
3020015020200,雛菜,"あ、そうだね～
雛菜、見てくる～！","Ah, you're right～
Hinana's gonna take a look～!"
3020015020210,透,割れそう,Feels like it's gonna split.
3020015020220,透,いいよ、割れて,"It's fine, even if it splits."
3020015020230,ケチ兵衛,"いたいいたい……なんだろうね
おい、おっかあ、おっかあ","Oh it hurts, it hurts... What on earth is this.
Oi, motheer, motheer."
3020015020240,ケチ兵衛,"頭、様子がおかしいんだ
見てくれねぇかな？","My head's feeling peculiar.
Could you take a look for me?"
3020015020250,母,"え？　なんだい、お前さん
どうしたんだい？","Hm? What bothers you, my sonn.
What ails you?"
3020015020260,母,"……あらやだ、お前さん
頭から木の芽が生えてるわよ","...Oh dear. My sonn,
there's a bud growing out of your head."
3020015020270,ケチ兵衛,"え……？
何それ","Eh...?
What's that supposed to mean."
3020015020280,母,だから、木の芽が生えてるのよ,"Like I said, the bud of a tree's shooting out."
3020015020290,ケチ兵衛,ええ？,Ehh?
3020015020300,ケチ兵衛,────あ、そうか,"────Ah, I see."
3020015020310,ケチ兵衛,"さくらんぼ、種のまま食っちまったから
頭から芽が出てきちまったんだよ","The cherries I ate had their seeds in them,
so it went up to my head and sprouted a bud."
3020015020320,ケチ兵衛,どうしよう？,Whatever shall I do?
3020015020330,母,"知らないわよ
抜いた方がいいんじゃないの？","I wouldn't know myself.
Might it be better to just pull it out?"
3020015020340,ケチ兵衛,抜いた方がいいって……,Pull it out…
3020015020350,ケチ兵衛,"だけど、せっかく生えてきたんだから
もったいねぇ","Still, it'd be a waste to pull it out when it's already 
sprouted a bud."
3020015020360,ケチ兵衛,そのままにしとこう,I'll leave it as it is.
3020015020370,off,"そのうち、芽はどんどんどんどん大きくなり
春になるってぇと、桜が満開でございまして────","Soon, the bud grew expansively. 
And when spring came, a huge sakura tree in 
full bloom could be seen────"
3020015020371,円香＆小糸＆雛菜,おじゃまします,"Hello, we're here to visit."
3020015020380,雛菜,透先輩～、大丈夫～？,Toru-senpai～ Are you alright～?
3020015020390,透,んー,Mnn.
3020015020400,小糸,"あ……ど、動画？
今の音","Ah... W-Was that a video?
That sound."
3020015020410,雛菜,何見てたの～？,What were you watching～?
3020015020420,透,なんか、落語,"Well, rakugo."
3020015020430,雛菜,"へ～？
透先輩、落語とか見るの～？","Heh～?
Toru-senpai watches rakugo～?"
3020015020440,透,"はじめて見た、この前
寄席ってやつ","I saw one for the first time the other day.
The one that's called yose."
3020015020450,透,"なんか、紛れるから
鳴ってた方が、痛み","Like, the noise helps with it.
Easing the pain."
3020015020460,雛菜,そっか～,I see～
3020015020470,透,"うう……ねー、生えてない？
頭、桜の木","Ughh... Hey, isn't there one?
A sakura tree. On top of my head."
3020015020480,小糸,と、透ちゃん、夢でも見てたの……？,"T-Toru-chan, did you see that in a dream 
or something...?"
3020015020490,透,"あー……
ううん、夢じゃなくて……","Ahh...
Nah, it wasn't a dream..."
3020015020500,円香,"これ、お見舞い
